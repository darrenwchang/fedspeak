<p>The mood of our directors varies from pessimism to optimism. If any 
consensus exists, it is that business activity in the Sixth District 
will continue to weaken slightly. Many major economic indices should 
drift downward or mark time for the next two months at least.</p>
<p>In the pessimistic vein, a leading department store recently 
informed us that their sales are even with a year ago, but only 
because of the addition of branches; unit sales, of course, are 
lower. The store reported that labor costs were up 8 to 10 percent 
and profits were off. They were pessimistic about future department 
store sales and did not anticipate a quick economic recovery. A 
telephone survey of department stores indicates this conclusion is 
shared by many retailers throughout the Southeast.</p>
<p>According to directors' reports, retail sales in some areas have 
been adversely affected because of a diversion of purchasing power 
to private schools which have sprung up in response to integration 
orders. Lumber mills in many areas have not been operating at 
profitable levels, and one major mill is planning to close down 
operations for three to six weeks to adjust inventories. A recovery 
in this industry is anticipated by the end of the year. The coal 
industry in Tennessee is also stymied at the Mine Safety Act, with 
which the industry claims it is impossible to comply.</p>
<p>The temporary closing of oil leasing in the Gulf because of <br/>
  oil-slick problems continues to cause a slump in the Louisiana Gulf 
Coast area. The outlook for the immediate future is pessimistic. 
Difficulty in obtaining insurance will also continue to hold up 
construction in the wake of Hurricane Camille. Also, a strike by 
2,600 workers at Gulf States Power is hamstringing new construction 
in Baton Rouge and other areas served by this utility.</p>
<p>The employment outlook remains bleak at the large number of military 
and aerospace installations in the South. Financial districts of 
major metropolitan areas are expected to continue to experience a 
reduction in employment occurring throughout the brokerage business, 
and there has been some reduction in employment at a large bank.</p>
<p>A recent canvass of institutional mortgage lenders indicates 
pessimistic outlook for single- and multi-family housing starts. 
Atlanta and Miami were the only moderately bright spots.</p>
<p>Higher prices of vegetables, peaches, and other agricultural 
commodities may be in prospect because of lower crop estimates and 
delayed plantings. Production estimates of citrus fruit, however, 
remain bullish despite a mild drought.</p>
<p>On the optimistic side of the ledger, many new plant locations and 
large-scale construction projects have been reported recently. For 
example, central Alabama will be receiving a modular home plant, a 
poultry plant, and a foundry for production of parts for automobiles 
and other products. In southern Louisiana, a new chemical plant has 
been announced and a large addition to an existing plant is planned. 
In the Birmingham area, a rash of construction projects has been 
announced. In the New Orleans area, plans for a new shopping center 
and another large motel have been announced. Potential public 
construction in that area includes a large bridge, an airport, and a 
stadium.</p>
<p>One director has reported a sizable increase in new orders because 
of a revival of capital projects that had been postponed last year.</p>
<p>A real bright spot in our District has been the Orlando area, where 
construction should continue to boom as Disneyworld gains momentum. 
Construction will soon be commencing on a very large residential 
project south of Orlando.</p>
<p>If a tentative wage settlement is ratified by ground workers of 
National Airlines this week, it will provide a stimulus to activity 
in southeast Florida in the coming weeks.</p>

</p>, <p>We strive to advance policy that promotes economic well-being.</p>, <p><a href=""/region-and-community/regional-economic-indicators/beige-book-archive"">â€¹ Back to Archive Search</a></p>, <p><strong>May 20, 1970</strong></p>, <p>Discussions Monday (May 18) and last Friday with First District 
Reserve bank directors and other area business leaders failed to 
turn up any traces of a crisis mentality in the business community. 
Those participants, including representatives of banking, retailing, 
and a wide diversity of manufacturing activities, generally showed a 
restrained but marked bullishness.</p>, <p>The primary explanation for this outlook was found in the common 
tendency to focus on a two to three year period for planning 
purposes, while placing little or no emphasis on the adverse 
developments which may occur in the next two to three quarters. In 
short, the businessmen are focusing on the far side of the valley, 
having already discounted any reasonable downturn which might 
develop this year.</p>, <p>In support of this psychology, it may be noted that a common remark 
of both merchants and manufacturers was that volume is holding up 
well, but profits are off sharply. Nevertheless, no instances were 
found in which this had yet led to a curtailment of capital 
expenditure plans for the rest of 1970, and corroborating evidence 
of this is found in the observation of three different commercial 
bankers that business loan demand had risen to historic highs in the 
last week or two at their institutions. They also uniformly noted 
that current interest rate levels are in no way deterring commercial 
loan demand.</p>, <p>Very little mention of the depressed state of the stock market was 
noted among the business leaders contacted, suggesting that they 
tend to view it as a separate entity, with few potential ""spillover 
effects"" on the course of real economic activity. Nor did the 
trucking strike elicit much comment as a depressing factor. 
Apparently, the wholesale and retail sectors have largely escaped 
any severe effects by means of a greatly increased reliance on the 
United Parcel Service, and in some instances, parcel post. Among 
manufacturers, serious truck strike effects seem to be highly 
spotty. As an example of firms which have been affected, the Cabot 
Corporation, large supplier of raw materials to the tire industry, 
reports increasing shipments problems.</p>, <p>The machine tool and producers' durable industries present a mixed 
picture. The Torrington Corporation, large manufacturer of ball 
bearings for automotive use, has definitely felt the decline in auto 
production, but reports that orders in farm equipment and two-cycle 
engines have risen more than enough to offset it. Layoffs have been 
negligible, and capital expenditure plans revised only slightly. The 
Norton Corporation reports a similar situation in its machine tool 
lines, but notes a definite softening of orders in its industrial 
abrasives division. On the other hand, Mr. Keyser of our board of 
directors reports a statewide softening of machine tool activity in 
Vermont.</p>, <p>The recreation industry in northern New England has experienced 
record levels of revenues all winter and thus far into the spring, 
although merchants in these areas as well as on Cape Cod do report 
some slack in advance bookings for the coming summer.</p>, <p>On the financial side, commercial banks report their deposit 
situation as largely stable, with no prospects for normal growth in 
the near future. Such weakness as was reported seems concentrated in 
corporate CDs and individual demand deposits. Thrift institutions, 
on the other hand, are in a worse position, with May deposit losses 
already offsetting most of their March-April gains. One- to three-family residential housing sales have declined drastically over the 
winter in most of the New England urban areas, and apartment 
construction is also showing signs of letting down.</p>, <p>In summary, neither continued tightness in credit markets nor 
prospects for substantial declines in profit levels over the rest of 
the year have yet acted to dissuade the business community from its 
basic outlook. A marked letdown in consumer spending would probably 
do so, but no signs of one have developed to date.</p>, <p class=""i9-c-footer__content--header"">

pessimism prevails in the Seventh District. Developments in 
Southeast Asia and the Middle East, racial strife, student unrest, 
high interest rates, the decline in the stock market, the squeeze on 
profits, the persistence of price inflation, rising unemployment, 
""unreasonable"" labor demands, and strikes (especially the truckers' 
strikes) are likely to be mentioned in any discussion of recent 
trends and future prospects. Probably some decisions are being 
delayed pending clarification of current uncertainties. Whatever the 
""facts"" may be, a correspondent writes, ""Men's thoughts control 
their actions.""</p>, <p>One of the problems in drawing a consensus by citing individual 
views on developments at the present time is that for every 
assertion an antithetical view could be offered. Some advocate price 
and wage controls; others regard such controls as anathema. Some 
demand that the Federal Reserve System ease credit, others insist 
that policy should have remained highly restrictive. Some worry over 
rising unemployment; others believe a ""shakeout"" is essential. Some 
expect a continuing decline in real activity through 1970; others 
are sure that the low point is past or near at hand. Some bankers 
think loan demand remains as strong as ever; others believe demand 
has eased.</p>, <p>The truckers' strikes and lockouts had a deep impact in the Seventh 
District in April and May, particularly in the Chicago area. Output 
of steel, autos, appliances, radio-TV, machinery and equipment, and 
many other goods has been slowedâ€”some plants are closed completely. 
Some construction projects using structural steel have been 
virtually at a standstill. Some retailers have been unable to obtain 
certain goods. In the Chicago area, it is estimated that 125,000 
workers are out of work currently because of the strikes, in 
addition to about 40,000 truck drivers.</p>, <p>Increasing uncertainties have entered the capital goods picture. 
Most statements of construction machinery producers indicate sales 
to distributors have been good, but one large producer reports 
inventories piling up at the dealer level. Among capital goods, 
machine tools have been hard hit by order declines. Machine tool 
output has not declined as much as orders, but some surplus capacity 
has developed. As a result of rainy weather, crop plantings have 
been delayed and farm machinery sales continue weak.</p>, <p>Construction declines are largely confined to single-family homes. 
Carpenters have become more readily available, but most building 
trades continue in short supply. Mortgage money is believed to have 
eased ""dramatically"" in the Detroit area.</p>, <p>Orders for major household appliances have improved in recent 
months. Demand for certain consumer residential goods, including 
motorcycles, golf carts, and bicycles is excellentâ€”pressing 
capacity to the limit in some cases.</p>, <p>Although output schedules for autos indicate a strong revival in May 
and June, pessimism in automotive centers has been spreading. 
Perhaps this reflects the failure of retail sales to confirm 
expectations of improving demand.</p>, <p>
Developments in the steel industry are so clouded by the truck 
strikes that generalizations on order trends are not possible, but a 
short-term increase in output is certain when the strikes are 
settled.</p>, <p>Job markets have eased in all major areas, but there has been no 
significant improvement in the supply of trainable younger workers. 
The easing of supply of college graduates has been dramatic. Summer 
jobs for undergraduates are scarcer than at any time in recent 
years. Many experienced executives are seeking jobs, partly as a 
result of the ""fine combing"" of white collar staffs. A student 
seeking summer work at a large automotive firm was asked, ""Why do we 
want trainees when we're firing vice presidents?""</p>, <p>Complaints over ""tight money"" are widespread. Increased concern is 
expressed over the ""liquidity squeeze,"" especially in small- and 
medium-sized businesses. Payments frequently are delayed, but there 
has been no significant rise in outright defaults or bankruptcies. 
Comments on the strength of loan demand vary from bank to bank. This 
may reflect varying degrees of emphasis on the means by which 
potential customers are discouraged.</p>, <p>A large bank states its ""average cost of money"" is 8-1/4 percent. 
Banks are not now able to raise CD money at ceiling rates. The 
common view of lenders and borrowers is that interest rates will 
either remain high or rise somewhat. However, there are indications 
that some corporate bond issues are being postponed and are awaiting 
more favorable conditions.
</p>, <p>District analysts who emphasize the ""money supply"" expect the 
decline in activity to last at least through the third and probably 
the fourth quarter.</p>, <p>Of course, there are many who believe the decline in the stock 
market presages a much more severe drop in general business than is 
yet apparent.</p>, <p class=""i9-c-footer__content--header"">

six weeks largely because of trucking strikes and strikes against 
several major rubber companies. Widespread campus disturbances in 
the District have forced a number of universities to close and 
undoubtedly have had an adverse impact on business conditions in 
local areas. This Bank's regular monthly survey of about 70 large 
manufacturing companies in the District reflected the softening in 
nationwide industrial activity last fall and early winter. Signs of 
a bottoming were evidenced in the survey taken in April, but the May 
survey revealed sharp setbacks during the month of April in key 
series such as new orders and shipments and a marked deterioration 
in employment and the workweek, presumably because of work 
stoppages. The District's insured unemployment rate, which had been 
edging moderately upward (from 1 percent last October to 2 percent 
in late March), jumped one percentage point during April to 3 
percent.</p>, <p>At a meeting of about 40 business economists, held at the Bank on 
May 15, there were mixed reports concerning recent price behavior. 
The majority maintained that wage-cost pressures, in the face of 
slack demand, are so great as to make it easy to ""pass on"" higher 
prices. Some economists, however, reported ""under the table"" 
discounting and price rebates, which presumably are not being 
recorded in the official price indexes. Specifically, an economist 
from a major rubber company said his firm's price index for tires, 
based on actual transactions prices and reflecting the mix of 
consumer purchases, had risen during the past year only about <br/>
one-third as much as the BLS price index for tires. Economists from the 
chemical industries reported recent weakness in chemical prices and 
noted that few chemical products were selling at list prices.</p>, <p>Other points of interest emerging from the meeting included a report 
by an economist from a large machine tool company in Cleveland that 
his firm was living off backlogs, that business booked in April was 
only one-quarter of what they would normally receive at this time of 
the year, and that they had not yet booked a single new order in 
May. Economists from two major auto companies believed the worst of 
the cutback in new car sales and production was over and that, 
following leveling tendencies in the second and third quarters, 
sales would recover later in the year. Economists from the steel 
industry expect the current favorable trade balance in steel to 
deteriorate later in the year, with a strong increase in imports and 
an easing in exports. On the other hand, the steel industry should 
soon begin to feel the effects of hedge buying in anticipation of a 
possible strike next year.</p>, <p>Among the comments received from this Bank's directors at a joint 
board meeting held on May 14, there were reports that markets for 
auto components and consumer electronics are becoming softer. One 
director said that one industry in which his firm is a major factor, 
flat glass, isâ€”and would remainâ€”in the doldrums until auto 
production and construction show improvement, but he was not 
optimistic. Several directors emphasized that the demand for coal is 
the greatest since World War II; stockpiles are low and there is 
difficulty in receiving supplies. (This implies continued upward 
pressure on coal prices, which have risen considerably during the 
past year; also ""brownouts""are likely this summer.) One director, 
the dean of a graduate school, reported that this year's graduates 
are harder to place. The market for Ph.Ds, especially mathematicians 
and statisticians, is suffering, reflecting the cutback in 
Government grants and other financial support for education. 
Directors from large banks said they are struggling to maintain 
their deposits, while directors from country banks were experiencing 
rising time deposits.</p>, <p>Some recent conversations of this Bank's officers within the 
District in recent days indicate that businessmen expect corporate 
profits to be off sharply in the second quarter because of the 
trucking strikes and the slack in business. Some of the businessmen 
contacted expect a minor recovery in profits in the third quarter, 
but do not look for any major improvement before the final quarter 
of 1970.

members surveyed at a mid-May meeting in Dallas. A recession is 
considered possible by a number of the board members, but this 
prospect is causing less concern than inflation since there is a 
widespread belief among the directors that a recession would be 
short and mild. A liquidity crisis is mentioned as a possibility by 
only one-third of the respondents, and the odds attached to this 
outcome are relatively low. With this overall economic outlook, the 
board members expected sales to show no increase or only a small 
increase in 1970, while profits are expected to decline. One 
director thought there might be a fall of more than 5 percent in 
both sales and profits.</p>, <p>Every board member reported that employee wages in their firms were 
being increased in 1970. This direct experience with higher wage 
costs may be one reason for the almost unanimous concern with 
inflation, ahead of other economic problems. The smallest wage 
increase (4 percent) was cited by an academic leader, while the 
largest (10 percent) was mentioned by a banker. The nonbanking 
businessmen mentioned 6 percent most often as the wage adjustment 
they were making this year.</p>, <p>The respondents were unanimous in their view that the Federal budget 
would operate with a deficit this year. Apparently, the 
Administration's forecast of a budget surplus is not accepted within 
the business and financial community, although a few directors 
thought the deficit might be small.</p>, <p>Despite some concern about a mild recession, acknowledgment of 
higher labor costs, and a generally poor outlook for profits this 
year, there were no reports of employment cutbacks by the bankers 
and businessmen interviewed and no indication that employment cuts 
were currently being considered. In fact, plans for very modest 
expansion of the labor force were noted by a couple of respondents. 
This reported maintenance of employment levels is consistent with 
the aggregate data for the Eleventh District, which show total 
employment still edging upward. The increase in employment, however, 
has not been sufficient to absorb all of the new labor force 
entrants in the District states. Thus, there has been an increase in 
unemployment in the Eleventh District since the end of 1969, and 
unemployment insurance activity is at a considerably higher level.</p>, <p>The respondents to our survey did note some softening in planned 
plant and equipment spending. More than half indicated that their 
January expectations had been revised downward; the estimates of the 
magnitude of the downward revision were vague but apparently 
indicated, in most cases, trimming around the edges rather than 
wholesale slashing. An executive of one major manufacturing concern 
did indicate that planned plant and equipment spending was 
undergoing a ""substantial"" cutback.</p>, <p>
The Texas industrial production index edged up in March, but has 
generally flattened since the beginning of 1970. Increased demand 
for petroleum and petro-chemical products has helped to strengthen 
the economy in both Texas and other District states. Oil production 
in the Eleventh District has remained near record levels throughout 
the spring, usually a period of seasonal slack.</p>, <p>At the same time, drilling activity has been rebounding from a 27-year low. Construction contract activity in the District showed 
renewed strength in the first quarter of 1970, compared with either 
the year-earlier period or the fourth quarter of 1969. Nonbuilding 
construction contracts were up considerably, buoyed by two very 
large contracts; nonresidential contracts also showed a sizable 
increase. A seasonal expansion in construction employment has 
occurred this spring, although the gain came earlier and was 
somewhat less than usual.</p>, <p>Department store sales in the Eleventh District through early May 
were up moderately in dollar value, but less than the amount 
required to offset inflation. Sales in early May appeared somewhat 
stronger than has been the case for the year as a whole so far.</p>, <p>Agricultural activities throughout most of the Eleventh District are 
progressing under generally favorable weather conditions. Cash 
receipts from farm marketings in the District states were up 
substantially in the first two months of 1970, compared with year-earlier levels.</p>, <p>Loan demand in the Eleventh District remained sluggish in April, as 
total loans at weekly reporting commercial banks declined 
contraseasonally. With both time and savings deposits increasing, 
District banks added considerably to their holdings of securities, 
particularly municipals. Time deposits have increased recently due 
mainly to the sale of large CDs. Some tightening in District bank 
reserve positions in April is reflected in the increase in weekly 
average net Federal funds purchased and in discount window 
borrowings, compared with the March levels.</p>, <p class=""i9-c-footer__content--header"">

Directors. Perhaps the most pervasive comments revolve about 
construction industry wage settlements. The extremely high national 
rate of wage increase is mirrored in the District, but of more 
significance, current and emerging wage demands will probably give a 
new lift to the national spiral. Construction is at a standstill in 
some areas of the District, as new wage bargaining proceeds. 
Excessive increases in construction costs are an important part of 
the reason for the reduced volume of new construction awards, which 
will show up in reduced construction activity six months or so 
hence. Even now, it is reported, there is a virtual absence of small 
construction projects of $750,000 or less.</p>, <p>The magnitude of wage increases in construction, and in other 
industries as well, is causing many to doubt the validity of 
attempting to bring wage-cost inflation under control by monetary 
and fiscal policies. There is a strong belief that stabilization 
goals can be accomplished only if the unbridled power of labor 
unions is curbed. In this connection, it was noted that some local 
memberships in their push for large gains have effectively 
overthrown the guidance of national leaders. It was interesting, 
too, to hear that the top construction company in the United States 
last year is a nonunion firm.</p>, <p>Retail sales are reported in the range of from firm to down by 
varying amounts. Where sales were reported weak, it was indicated 
that the public is deeply concerned about the prospect of recession.</p>, <p>Despite excellent production prospects, producers of farm crops are 
discouraged by low prices for many of these crops. Bankers in the 
High Plains report that increasing numbers of farmers, particularly 
wheat farmers, are quitting because of low prices and restricted 
average allotment programs. The attrition appears to be 
substantially higher than the average for other recent years caused 
by the changing structure of the industry. The livestock sector 
continues to remain relatively favorable. However, the impact of 
higher livestock prices is expected to be offset by increasing 
costs, resulting in little change in net farm income measured in 
current dollars. Consequently, net farm income measured in real 
terms is likely to be down.</p>, <p>The 8-percent increase in net farm income in 1969, combined with 
efforts of farm producers to increase efficiency by going to larger 
equipment and other technological improvements, has caused purchases 
by farmers to increase. Farm machinery dealers report sales of farm 
equipment to be unusually good. They are fearful, however, that to a 
considerable extent current sales are being made at the expense of 
normal future sales. Conversation with farm purchasers indicates 
that they are buying now because they expect equipment prices to 
rise substantially as new union contracts are negotiated. Farm 
implement people expect Walter Reuther's death to make bargaining in 
the farm machinery industry more difficult.
</p>, <p>It is apparent that most Board members do not believe that a 
recession will be an acceptable route to the goal of price 
stability. While they probably would not argue that the economy is 
in recession, the course of developments and the sharp April rise in 
unemployment tend to strengthen the view that the economy is headed 
in that direction.</p>, <p>Banker members of the Board are concerned with the continuing effort 
to limit overall credit growth by restricting growth in the banking 
system. They believe that this already has gone too far in squeezing 
bank liquidity. Moreover, they argue, monetary policy is forcing too 
much banking outside of banks and this is potentially dangerous. The 
resort to commercial paper financing by business firms is cited as 
an obvious example. The removal of interest rate ceilings on large 
CDs would be a step in rectifying some of the current difficulties 
and potential problems in this regard.</p>, <p class=""i9-c-footer__content--header"">

District are not as apparent as in the rest of the nation, various 
pieces of quantitive and qualitative evidence suggest that the rate 
of District economic growth has at least slowed down. At the same 
time, however, there does not seem to be any diminution in the 
inflationary psychology of area residents. Consumers apparently are 
cutting back on their level of consumption, and scattered instances 
of businessmen either postponing or at least stretching out some of 
their capital expenditures are being noticed. Currently, a number of 
construction workers in the District are on strike and indications 
are that most of these strikes will last for awhile. Information 
relating to the Teamsters' strike is very sketchy, but it appears 
that some firms are beginning to be affected.</p>, <p>During the go-around at the last meeting of the Board of Directors 
of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, the directors generally 
felt that business conditions were softening. As evidence of these 
observations, the directors cited such things as unemployment 
increasing in their areas, retail sales becoming sluggish, 
businessmen hesitating to build up inventories, and an almost 
universal observation of slowing in auto sales. In addition, one 
director was aware of a case where a steel company supplying the 
auto industry has cut back its orders of iron ore pellets. One 
director, on the other hand, observed that lumber and wood products 
manufacturers in western Montana have become optimistic in their 
expectations of sales during the latter half of this year. These 
producers were severely affected by the downturn in housing 
construction, but not expect their sales to increase with the 
anticipated upturn in housing.</p>, <p>In spite of the business slowdown, the directors felt that 
inflationary psychology has not abated in their local areas, but 
that recent events in Indochina have not had a discernible separate 
effect on inflationary psychology. They also felt that people are 
concerned not only with the effect of inflation, but also with all 
other areas of unrest in this country. One director addressed 
himself to the discriminatory impact of inflation. Although he was 
careful to point out that the problem was also due to other factors, 
he felt that farmers are feeling the ill effects of inflation while 
not sharing in the benefits. For example, he said that while farmers 
recently have had to pay more for input items, the prices of their 
products have not increased accordingly. As a result, the profits of 
farm operations have fallen off.</p>, <p>Scattered pieces of information suggest that area businessmen may be 
postponing or at least stretching out their capital expenditures. 
During the first three months of this year, the valuation of 
building permits issued for nonresidential building in the Ninth 
District were about 9 percent below the comparable year-earlier 
period. After adjusting for cost increases over the past year, this 
implies that nonresidential building activity is about 16 percent 
below a year ago. In addition, one director was aware of a 
manufacturing firm in his area that has set back the letting of 
contracts from 60 to 120 days. Also, a Minneapolis-based milling and 
food related conglomerate reported recently that they had cut back 
their capital expenditures. During the current fiscal year they 
expect to spend about $5 million for fixed capital, an amount down 
substantially from the $8.2 million spent last year. Two cases were 
cited at the recent directors meeting, however, which are expected 
to lead to increasing capital expenditures. In one case, it was 
stated that a railroad based in the Ninth District would have to 
expand its capital expenditures to take advantage of the economies 
of scale inherent in a recent merger of four lines. In the second 
case, a copper producer in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan has 
undertaken a housing program which, when completed, will double the 
size of the town in which the mine is located. The ostensible reason 
for the new program was to shorten the commuting time of workers, 
for a number of their employees are now commuting daily from points 
50 to 100 miles away.</p>, <p>Major construction contract negotiations are underway in two 
sections of the District. In Minnesota about 10,000 to 12,000 
workers are currently out on strike and about 15,000 to 20,000 
workers are directly affected. Although some disputes have already 
been settled, the majority of union contracts expiring this spring 
are still in the process of negotiation. In general, completed 
negotiations call for wages to increase by more than 50 percent over 
the next two years. The strikes still in progress are expected to 
continue throughout the next three to four weeks.</p>, <p>In the highway and heavy construction sectors, the carpenters and 
Teamsters have settled, but the operating engineers appear to be a 
long from settlement. According to a recent newspaper article, 
operating engineers in Minnesota reportedly turned down an offer 
that would increase their wages by 55 percent over the next two and 
a half years presumably because of union dissatisfaction regarding 
the timing of the increases. In the building construction trades, a 
number of strikes are still in progress and probably will not be 
settled for at least three to four weeks.</p>, <p>In South Dakota, contract negotiations are underway in Sioux Falls 
and Rapid City, the only unionized areas in the state. All building 
construction has been shut down in Sioux Falls as a result of a 
strike by the operating carpenters are in the process of negotiating 
new contracts, but are still working. The unions are requesting wage 
increases of about 15 to 20 percent per year over the next three 
years as opposed to the 10 percent to 12 percent per year increase 
received at the time of the last settlement three years ago.</p>, <p class=""i9-c-footer__content--header"">

the head office and at the Buffalo branch were solicited for their 
own and others' opinions regarding current economic conditions and 
the near-term outlook. In the summary, the responses showed 
substantial agreement concerning (1) a tendency for capital 
expenditures to be stretched out, where feasible; (2) no decline in 
inflationary expectations; and (3) an easing of the labor market in 
certain categories, but continued strong upward wage pressures.</p>, <p>Some businessmen reportedly are deferring or stretching out capital 
spending plans where this is feasible. Apparently there is a growing 
uneasiness about existing capital spending plans. One machine tool 
manufacturer with a fairly large national business has recently 
suffered a decline of more than<br/> 
one-third in new orders. Spending 
plans that are being completed as originally contemplated include 
those where the firms have ""no choice""; namely, programs that are 
already in process, particularly if these have long lead times, and 
programs that are connected with pollution control. In western New 
York, for instance, 65-70 percent of the current capital spending by 
the food processing industry is government mandated under air and 
water pollution programs.</p>, <p>Most of the directors expressed the belief that businessmen were 
either as concerned about inflation as they had been, or 
increasingly so. One director noted a growing fear and puzzlement 
over whether the Federal Reserve System and the Administration ""mean 
business"" in the fight against inflation. Another director observed 
that industry fears wage and price controls and has consequently 
raised its profit margins.</p>, <p>There was general agreement that businessmen are more concerned 
about the expected continuation of inflation than they are about a 
recession. There were varying opinions about when the ""floor of the 
valley"" would be reached, but apparently most directors did not 
think the slowdown would be very deep. A few of the directors noted 
that industry's principal concern has to do with the squeeze on 
profits, since increasing costs cannot be easily passed on in a 
sluggish period.</p>, <p>Conditions in the labor market are very uneven, to judge from the 
directors' remarks. Some directors noted that it had become more 
difficult for college graduates to find jobs in certain categories; 
e.g., as engineers and physicists. Moreover, unskilled help is 
apparently in easy supply. However, qualified skilled labor 
continues to be tight. Particular note of this was made with regard 
to the Buffalo and Rochester areas.</p>, <p>Some of the directors observed that despite the easing in some labor 
markets, there was no detectable easing of upward wage pressures. 
Special comment was made regarding the steep demands by the building 
trades unions in the Rochester area. These reportedly stem from the 
very generous settlements obtained last year by the same trades in 
the Buffalo area. Note was made of wage increases granted by some 
businessmen in their lowest paying job categories.</p>, <p class=""i9-c-footer__content--header"">

month, according to a recent poll of business opinion. Results from 
the May business outlook survey show that most manufacturers 
canvassed in the Third Federal Reserve District are experiencing 
either no change or actual declines in sales and new orders. 
Moreover, sales for April did not live up to expectations, 
indicating the current slump is somewhat more pronounced than 
anticipated earlier. However, area executives polled see no further 
deterioration of business activity in the immediate months ahead.</p>, <p>In addition, optimism remains high for regional activity over the 
longer term. Since January, a majority of manufacturers polled have 
held rising expectations for the second half of 1970. At latest 
count, more than two out of three area industrialists see a pickup 
in the economy during the fall and winter of 1970.</p>, <p>Underlying this bullish outlook is an expected jump in both new 
orders and sales by yearend. Despite this anticipated acceleration 
in business activity, a majority of area manufacturers do not expect 
to add to their payrolls over the next six months. In addition, only 
one in four plans an increase in capital expenditures during the 
next half year.
</p>, <p>The outlook for prices remains inflationary. Better than three out 
of five respondents, unchanged from .a year ago, expect the upward 
trend for prices to continue for the balance of the year.</p>, <p>The expectations of area economists for the second half of 1970 
parallel those of manufacturing executives. The consensus view of 
business and bank economists in the Third District, according to a 
recent poll, is that the current downturn in business activity is 
bottoming out and that by fall the economy will be expanding once 
more. Prices, say regional economists, will continue their upward 
climb, but at a modestly reduced rate as the year progresses.</p>, <p>Comments on the current scene by members of the board of directors 
are varied. Two members, a banker and a utilities executive, 
indicate that sentiment among their associates has become rather 
gloomy in recent weeks. The gloom stems from the view that the 
current dip in the economy will develop into an all-out recession. 
Another cause of this gloom is the feeling that inflation cannot be 
stopped without a serious recession.</p>, <p>Two industrialists on the board, however, do not share this 
pessimistic sentiment. One indicated that he saw some further 
slowing in the pace of business activity, but believed that a 
recession would be avoided largely because of a pickup in consumer 
spending. The other industrialist expected no further declines in 
the volume of business. He indicated, though, that he was less 
certain about the economy and more confused now than at anytime in 
his experience. Further, this industrialist is skeptical about the 
ability of current policy to make much headway against inflation.</p>, <p>All board members expressed concern over declines in the stock 
market. Some pointed to the gloomy psychology it is creating; others 
are concerned by the possibility of financial failures; still others 
are concerned that a market decline of current magnitudes might 
further undermine consumer spending. In a related point, one board 
member expressed serious concern over the taut liquidity positions 
of many corporations.</p>, <p>Basically, the business opinion in the Third District reflects the 
view that the economy has slowed more than expected several months 
back, and at best only modest reductions in the rate of inflation 
can be expected by the end of 1970. Also, there is much concern 
about developments in the financial sector.</p>, <p class=""i9-c-footer__content--header"">

 District survey respondents, except for those in certain trades and services, indicate declines 
recently in retail <br/>
salesâ€”particularly automobiles. This continues a 
slackening trend evident in this District throughout the current 
year. Manufacturers also report declines in shipments, new orders, 
and backlogs of orders,, This situation apparently pervades both 
durable and nondurable lines and remains typical of the District's 
largest industry, textiles.
</p>, <p>Inventories are reported to be substantially unchanged from the 
previous month in manufacturing as well as in retail trade. 
Manufacturers, however, report higher levels of inventories than 
they desire, while retailers report inventory levels to be somewhat 
depleted.
</p>, <p><strong>Employment and Unemployment</strong><br/>
 Employment is reported to have declined 
in the District during the past month, in manufacturing as well as 
in trade and services The decline continues a generally weakening 
employment situation existing since January. Hours worked per week 
have been reduced further, and initial claims for unemployment 
insurance apparently continue high. On the other hand, District 
businessmen indicate that good employees are still scarce in both 
the skilled and unskilled categories.</p>, <p><strong>Wages and Prices</strong><br/>
 District manufacturers report increases in both 
wages and prices over the past month as they have consistently done 
for the past year. Businessmen in trade and services indicate an 
even more pronounced upward tendency. Scattered indications of price 
declines have appeared in the textile and furniture industries.</p>, <p>
<strong>Construction</strong><br/>
 Residential construction activity in the District 
remains severely depressed. Nonresidential construction, however, is 
reported to have increased slightlyâ€”a reversal of previous months' 
reports.</p>, <p><strong>Loan Demand</strong><br/>
District bankers report that the demand for mortgage 
loans increased significantly during the past month. A number of 
bankers, however, indicate reluctance to accommodate this demand due 
to statutory rate ceilings and other factors. Business loan demand 
is reported to have increased somewhat over the past month as well, 
while consumer loan demand is apparently unchanged.</p>, <p><strong>Outlook</strong><br/>
 Uncertainty pervades the economic outlook among District 
businessmen and bankers due to both economic and noneconomic 
factors, including domestic social unrest and recent developments in 
the Vietnam War.</p>, <p><strong>Capital Spending</strong><br/>
 Survey respondents in manufacturing, particularly 
nondurable goods, indicate plant and equipment capacity to be in 
excess. Respondents in trade and services report their capacity to 
be inadequate. Both groups, however, apparently plan further 
increases.</p>, <p>Reserve bank directors confirm this consensus and report that, even 
in some instances where current capacity is more than adequate, 
spending plans are not being curtailed and are even being increased 
in certain cases due to a general feeling that inflationary 
conditions will continue.</p>, <p><strong>Inventory Investment</strong><br/>
 Manufacturers report current inventory levels 
to be excessive, but businessmen in trade and services feel they are 
too low, Reserve bank directors indicate a similar mixture of 
opinion. Adjustments are apparently still going on, and some 
respondents indicate that, while the largest share of inventory 
reduction has already passed, few significant increases are being 
planned.</p>, <p><strong>General Conditions and Consumer Spending</strong><br/>
 There is a consensus among 
District bankers that further declines are ahead for general 
business activity in the District. Moreover, Reserve bank directors 
indicate that consumer spending plans are being adjusted downward 
somewhat, reflecting largely a feeling of uncertainty over the 
future course of the national economy.</p>, <p class=""i9-c-footer__content--header"">

  There is no consistent pattern of views and anticipations 
regarding economic conditions in the Twelfth District. Moderate 
growth in business characterizes the District generally, including 
both Washington, one of the hardest hit sections, and Arizona, 
previously showing the greatest growth. Declining output and 
employment in some parts of Oregon are continuing and spreading, 
while both buoyant and depressed conditions are reflected in various 
areas of Southern California.</p>, <p>
<strong>Random Notes by Industry</strong><br/>
Reports on recent agricultural conditions 
vary from ""agricultural disaster due to weather"" and ""agricultural 
recession"" to ""excellent growing conditions and bumper crop 
prospects.""</p>, <p>
Logging and lumber mills continue slow, with outlook favorable until 
mid-1971. The layoff rate has been reduced at one large aerospace 
firm, but is becoming manifest in a limited way in some other 
industries. In education, wages are ""high"" despite heavy demand for 
the scarce new positions. Severe gasoline price wars are evident in 
many locations, aggravated by the introduction of new types of 
gasoline.</p>, <p>Housing generally continues in short supply with construction 
depressed, while apartment vacancy rates vary from low to very 
substantial. Industrial and commercial construction is ""fairly 
active"" in Utah. One manufacturer reports a volume market and good 
prices. Another reports a profit squeeze; he was ""forced to raise 
prices against a soft market; the raise was accepted as unavoidable"" 
(except for the attempted cut in distributors' margins).</p>, <p><strong>Summary for Selected Economic Aspects<br/>
Employment</strong><br/>
New jobs are becoming less easy to find, actual cutbacks in total employment are 
occurring in an increasing number of firms as a part of cost-reduction programs. Significant expiration of unemployment 
compensation benefits is expected in June and July in one area.</p>, <p><strong>Strikes</strong><br/>
Both current and anticipated labor difficulties were 
mentioned.</p>, <p><strong>Wages</strong><br/>
Wage conditions vary from constant to rising. There is even 
wider anticipationâ€”except in strictly agricultural communitiesâ€”of 
future wage boosts.</p>, <p><strong>Other Costs</strong><br/>
Increasing costs of purchased goods were mentioned, 
but one respondent writes that ""dealers are selling equipment at 
below cost to reduce inventories.""</p>, <p><strong>Prices</strong><br/>
Prices on the respondents' own products vary from ""recently 
strengthened markedly"" to ""started declining about 30 days ago."" 
Higher posted prices and competitive price-cutting left one 
industry's average retail price higher on balance; expectations are 
for hardening prices. Despite a slowdown in one area, a strong 
upward price trend was noted. In another, upward pressures are 
expected to continue with the rates of increase ""diminished from 
those of recent experience.""</p>, <p><strong>Profits</strong><br/>
In one industry expecting both wage increases and 
employment cutbacks, ""a number of companies have announced that they 
expect slow improvements in net earnings as 1970 proceeds.""</p>, <p>
<strong>Market Psychology</strong><br/>
In one sensitive-commodity industry, ""the 
psychology of buyers and sellers has changed recently"" (in a 
deflating direction): ""the tendency of buyers is to go increasingly 
to a hand-to-mouth basis."" </p>, <p><strong>Sales</strong><br/>
Sales reports vary from ""curtailed"" through ""constant"" to 
""up."" Higher new orders and lengthening delivery time were noted in 
one community. In the Portland zone retail sales ""have reflected a 
definite improvement within the last 30 days,"" in contrast to the 
more general expectation in that zone of even more softening in 
retail sales.</p>, <p><strong>Inventories</strong><br/>
Both higher and lower inventories are reported.</p>, <p>
<strong>Plant and Equipment Investment</strong> <br/>
Both high and low levels of capital 
spending, as well as ""no change,"" are reported, with cutbacks more 
frequently mentioned.</p>, <p><strong>Credit</strong> <br/>
According to the banker respondents, ""ample"" to ""adequate"" 
credit is available. Users of credit vary in their judgments on this 
score from ""a little easier to obtain,"" through ""very difficult, but 
not substantially more so than a year ago,"" to ""very tight for 
agricultural loans from commercial bank sources.""</p>, <p>Bank liquidity short of distress was noted. Expansion of several 
retirement communities is currently being held up for lack of funds. 
A continuing increase in overdue or delinquent receivables was 
reported, partly attributable to strike-induced delays. A large 
international conglomerate indicated that accounts receivable have 
slowed from 70 to 80 days; the very substantial costs involved could 
not be passed on.</p>, <p><strong>Policy </strong><br/>
 In one community the impotence of monetary policy and the 
need for wage and price controls had become the subject of common 
discussion on the street. Elsewhere the lack of needed wage-price

Reserve District, including directors at the head office and 
Louisville branch of the St. Louis Reserve Bank, officials of larger 
business firms and newspaper financial editors, was questioned with 
respect to their views concerning the economic outlook. Their 
comments point to some further decline in business activity in the 
near future, with an occasional expression of doubt as to the extent 
of recovery of business profits in the longer run.</p>, <p>Of greatest concern at the moment for most firms are the contracts 
which are being negotiated with labor unions and the anticipated 
higher wage settlements. The business representatives almost 
unanimously indicate that they will be unable to pass on all of the 
rising labor costs to consumers. A continuation of the profit 
squeeze of the first quarter of this year is therefore expected.</p>, <p>There are no indications of major layoffs of workers by those 
interviewed, except in the construction industry. Some firms are, 
however, reducing wage and salary costs by failing to replace 
workers who retire. A slackening in demand for labor is also 
indicated by the slowdown in demand for June college graduates. One 
business school dean reported a slowdown in growth of both job 
opportunities and in starting salaries compared with other recent 
years.
</p>, <p>Excluding stockbrokers, pessimism appears greatest in the 
automobile, chemical, construction, and defense industries in the 
Eighth District. Concern for their profit outlook in the immediate 
future and to a less extent in the longer run indicates some decline 
in demand for investment funds in these industries. A number of 
smaller industries which are associated with residential 
construction, notably furniture and fixtures, likewise view the 
outlook with little optimism. The breweries, food, and feed 
industries have apparently been little affected by the current 
economic slowdown and have made little change in their long-run 
spending plans. One representative of these industries remarked that 
his company was ""looking across the valley"" to a recovery later in 
the year.</p>, <p>
Great concern was expressed by a number of people for the major 
downward movement in the stock market. Several accredited this 
movement to restrictive monetary policies, which they believe were 
necessary to bring the rate of inflation down to a more moderate 
level. In some responses, and especially in the case of our own 
board members, a need for continued moderation in the rate of growth 
in the stock of money was indicated despite the problems involved in 
reducing demand to more sustainable levels.</p>, <p>Farm land prices apparently continue to decline in the predominantly 
agricultural areas of the Eighth District. Estimates of price 
declines during the first year run as high as $50 to $100 per acre 
on land that previously sold for $500 to $1,000 per acre.</p>, <p class=""i9-c-footer__content--header"">

Districts is based on information gathered from directors of the 
Reserve Banks, conversations with local bankers, businessmen and 
economists, regular monthly surveys of manufacturing and trade 
industries conducted by some of the Reserve Banks, and selected 
statistical measures of regional economic activity.</p>, <p>Reports from the Reserve Banks clearly indicate that the current 
overriding domestic concern is inflation. Businessmen contacted 
generally expect that prices will continue to increase at a rapid 
rate during the remainder of the year. There appears to be 
considerable skepticism regarding the ability of economic 
stabilization policies to achieve a significant reduction in the 
rate of inflation without generating an intolerable level of 
unemployment or a 
full-scale recession. Similarly, there is evidence 
of extensive concern about the persistence of strong upward wage 
pressures, despite some easing in labor markets. The
wage-push 
problem is particularly acute in the construction industries. Some 
of the other major factors that are contributing to an underlying 
tone of pessimism regarding the business situation are prospects for 
a continued squeeze on corporate profits, concern about the tight 
liquidity position of some firms, the recent decline in the stock 
market, and domestic social unrest.</p>, <p>There appears to be no consensus as to whether the economy is 
actually in a recessionâ€”or when the floor of the current slowdown 
will be realized. Views range from expectations of a further and 
deeper deterioration in real economic activity to beliefs that 
recovery is already in progress. The trucking strikes and lockouts 
have seriously disrupted business conditions in some areas, 
particularly in the Midwest. Several Districts noted that 
construction projects have been impeded because of steel shortages, 
and also because of widespread strikes in the building trades 
unions. There are also signs that some firms are postponing or 
stretching out capital spending projects where feasible.</p>, <p class=""i9-c-footer__content--header"">

 Sixth District directors have mixed opinions 
about future business conditions. If any consensus exists, it is 
that the economy has not yet bottomed out and that recovery will be 
less than spectacular when it comes. According to directors' reports 
and other sources of information, further weakening in sales, 
employment and production is likely. Department stores report lower 
volume and growing resistance to higher priced merchandise. Belt 
tightening by businesses has spread, and directors report many 
instances of slowdowns in capital spending. Employment and 
production cutbacks are common.</p>, <p><strong>Retail sales</strong><br/>
 Department stores surveyed report no discernible shift 
from the ""upstairs"" to the ""bargain basement"". However, customer 
resistance to higher priced brands has increased, with lower priced 
merchandise receiving the benefit. A canvass of merchants by one of 
our Branch offices indicated that they expect no improvement in 
sales within the near future. Regarding auto sales, distributors 
contacted report some shifting from larger cars to the compact 
sized, loaded with optional equipment. Rather than settling for a 
stripped-down version of a full-sized car, customers are purchasing 
lower priced equipment-packed models.</p>, <p><strong>Belt tightening</strong><br/>
 A profit squeeze is causing many businesses to trim 
fat wherever possible. Reports of capital expenditures being reduced 
or stretched out have been coming from several sources. A major 
airline reports more executives are flying coach, and some companies 
are pushing early retirements. Attrition is being allowed to take 
its toll, and the workweek is being reduced in some industrial 
areas.</p>, <p><strong>Production and employment</strong><br/>
 Cutbacksâ€”some sizableâ€”are occurring in 
steel, furniture, textiles, and rubber and paper products. A large 
steel producer in Alabama and a large aluminum company in Tennessee 
are reportedly cutting employment by as much as 20 percent. A 
Mississippi furniture manufacturer is reported to be trimming 
employment from 2,800 to 1,700. A 500-man cutback is imminent at 
another firm, and a District bank is cutting employmentâ€”this one by 
10 percent across the board. A regional airline is cutting its work 
force by 100, ""purely as an economy move"". A shorter workweek has 
also been used to adjust output: for example, a major rubber company 
is going on a four-day week.</p>, <p>A strike involving 5,000 workers at the Atomic Energy Commission's 
Oak Ridge, Tennessee, plant is entering its third month. Gulf states 
utilities continue to be picketed, and a walkout involving 1,200 has 
idled production at a Birmingham plant. The Florida Power and the 
Miami plumbers' strikes have been settled. The plumbers will receive 
about a 25 percent yearly pay boost over the three-year contract. 
Employment is stabilizing at two large military installations 
contacted. Recent employment cutbacks at these two installations 
have been accomplished by normal attrition.</p>, <p><strong>Capital spending and construction</strong><br/>
 Major utility construction is 
strong and a twenty-story office building will be built in Jackson, 
Mississippi. Despite postponements in capital spending, there have 
been some announcements of new plants and plant expansions, 
including a needle factory in Alabama, a $70 million expansion of a 
mining and industrial chemical complex in Tennessee, and a $15 
million expansion of an engine plant in south Alabama. Recent 
contacts with four Atlanta building supply companiesâ€”two in glass 
and one each in cabinets and plumbing suppliesâ€”indicate reduced 
volume and price cutting.</p>, <p><strong>Agriculture</strong><br/>
Soaking rains throughout the District have contributed 
to an excellent agricultural outlook. Prices of farm land have 
leveled recently after a steady rise, perhaps because of uncertainty 
about farm legislation and high interest rates.</p>, <p><strong>Loan terms</strong><br/>
A recent survey indicates a slight decline in the 
average interest rate on bank loans from February 15 to May 15. 
Firmer nonprice terms, however, nullified the effects of the lower 
interest rate. Loan demand has weakened slightly.</p>, <p class=""i9-c-footer__content--header"">

  well-known 
academicians were contacted in the preparation of this report. 
Because of noncomparable types of responses as well as wide 
differences of opinion, no general summary seems possible. 
Respondents' viewpoints ranged from serious concern over the 
economic outlook to satisfaction that we are about on course. Their 
comments, as given below, are separated on the basis of real versus 
monetary markets.</p>, <p><strong>Monetary Conditions and Capital Markets</strong><br/>

Professor Otto Eckstein characterized capital markets as currently 
being in a ""most unusual state"", attributing this to (1) the 
System's switch to aggregate targets, (2) the continuing high rate 
of inflation and suspicion that it will not abate, and (3) 
uncertainties wrought by Cambodia andâ€”particularlyâ€”the stock 
market. With respect to the Fed's current stance, Eckstein 
emphatically pointed out that policy can be judged as having been 
easier over the last few months only by a monetarist's standards. 
Measured from any starting month previous to February 1970, the 
widely touted 10 percent annual growth rate of money stock shrinks 
to 3 to 5 percent. On top of this moderate rate of growth, Eckstein 
interprets the events of April and May as having led to a greatly 
increased liquidity preference on the part of the public, concluding 
that endorsement of a 4 percent rate of monetary growth during the 
current period is ""really somewhat cavalier"".</p>, <p>Professor James Tobin concurred with Eckstein on this view of System 
policy, additionally pointing out that with a 4 or 5 percent rate of 
growth, money supply is shrinking in real terms. Tobin also voiced 
fears that the Fed's excessively tight policy in combination with 
its shift to aggregate targets has forced interest rates to a point 
well above the real rate of return on capital, a state of affairs he 
feels will depress real activity more than we are bargaining for.</p>, <p>At the opposite end of the spectrum was Professor Henry Wallich, who 
stated that Fed policy is threatening to become overly easy ""no 
matter how money stock is measured"".</p>, <p>
Views varied also on the causes and the implications of the stock 
market decline. Wallich feels the principal explanation is the 
necessary, but painful, adjustment of equity markets to a 9 percent 
bond market. Tobin, on the other hand, feels the decline has been 
serious, stating that it will have both wealth and cost of capital 
effects, and that it is symptomatic of a general economic malaise. 
When viewed from the more regional, micro outlook of our banking 
directors, money market conditions appeared more optimistic. Only a 
month ago all three of our Class A directors were reporting 
commercial loan demands at an all-time high at their respective 
institutions. Two now report that this situation has moderated to a 
degree where their banks can handle it. Our directors also report a 
healthy pickup in deposit inflows over the last three weeks in all 
categories, but particularly in consumer-type deposits. Mr. Kennedy 
noted that for the first time in 1970, deposit figures at his 
institution are now exceeding year-ago levels. Taken together, these 
factors represent a substantial shift toward optimism among our 
banking directors from a month ago.</p>, <p><strong>GNP and Real Market Aggregates</strong><br/>

Our academicians shifted positions in their discussion of the 
outlook in real markets, with Eckstein becoming the most bullish. He 
sees the economy currently hovering between recession and no growth, 
but remains convinced that most of the GNP markdown will occur in 
the first half of this year. While he hasn't made a run on his model 
for about three weeks now, he sees total 1970 GNP falling in the 
$982-$985 billion range, with unemployment at 5.0 to 5.2 percent by 
the year-end. Eckstein further offered the opinion that, if we do 
have a recession (however measured), it will be far and away the 
mildest of the postwar period.</p>, <p>Wallich similarly sees 1970 nominal GNP winding up in the $980-$985 
billion range, with a nominal fourth-quarter gain of about $15 
billion. While he identified unemployment, prices, and interest 
rates as all behaving worse than expected, he expressed confidence 
that the nominal GNP forecasts made earlier this year will hold up 
quite well. Noting how successive capital surveys have shown a 
consistency, he does not feel that capital expenditure plans are 
collapsing, and he sees the possibility of bringing the GNP deflator 
down to a level of 4 percent by the year-end. On the outlook for 
unemployment in the third and fourth quarters, he was somewhat more 
bearish than Eckstein.</p>, <p>Tobin once again provided the most gloomy assessment, predicting 
unemployment will rise to at least 5 1/2 percent by the year-end, 
and very possibly higher. He did not provide us with GNP projections 
for the next two quarters.</p>, <p>Again turning to the micro-oriented views of our directors, the 
picture is quite mixed. Mr. Robertson of the Bangor Punta Corp. 
(aircraft firearms, recreational equipment, farm products, etc.) 
reports that sales are continuing a sharp deterioration in nearly 
all their lines, with the one major exception the capital goods 
produced in their process engineering division. Their layoffs have 
been substantial, and capital expenditure plans have been cut back 
30 to 40 percent. Other directors, however, noted that layoffs seem 
to have subsided in their areas. Messrs. Cabot (Cabot Corp.) and 
Carter (Nashua Corp.) report their capital expenditure plans are 
continuing at or near the levels originally planned, althoughâ€”apropos of Tobin's point aboveâ€”Mr. Carter did note that their 
capital spending is becoming increasingly contingent upon securing 
reasonably priced financing. Other queries to our directors produced 
no shift in sentiment from the views they expressed a month ago.</p>, <p class=""i9-c-footer__content--header"">

lower their expectations on output and sales for the economy and for 
individual firms for the remainder of this year. Increasingly, 
expectations are that the ""low"" for the general economy will be in 
the third or fourth quarter with no substantial recovery until 1971. 
Labor markets have continued to ease, especially for marginal 
workers and middle management and professional types. Although most 
respondents have not observed a slowing in the rate of price 
inflation, price increases appear to be fewer in number and harder 
to sustain.</p>, <p>The general atmosphere is one of uneasiness rather than deep gloom. 
The stock market, price inflation, reduced liquidity, slow payments 
on receivables, lower profit margins, strikes, Cambodia, and civil 
unrest continue to be mentioned in any conversation. Nevertheless, 
very few informed persons expect a cumulative decline in the 
economy. Rather, the prevailing pessimism reflects the view that a 
significant improvement is not at hand, and may not occur until next 
year.</p>, <p>Consumers are said to be purchasing lower priced autos, furniture, 
appliances, television sets, and clothing, and to be reducing 
purchases of such foods as meats and delicatessen items. The. truck 
strike in the Chicago area has seriously depleted may retailers' 
inventories, making it difficult to discern shifts in consumer 
purchasing preferences. But outside Chicago, department stores 
report intensive price consciousness in shopping and reduced sales 
in most departments except in the ""budget or bargain basement"". 
Discount store sales are reported to be holding up well.</p>, <p>Many businesses are pushing cost-cutting programs through reductions 
of staff; lower outlays for advertising, public relations, 
entertainment, and other items not directly related to production; 
inventory curtailments; and postponements of short lead-time capital 
expenditures.
</p>, <p>The truck strike continues to be a very significant depressing force 
on output and retail trade in the Chicago area. The embargo on truck 
shipments of components and finished goods to and from the Chicago 
area, of course, continues to hamper output in other parts of the 
country. The impact of the strike is said to be especially hard on 
smaller manufacturers and retailers who are less able to utilize 
alternative arrangements for moving goods.</p>, <p>
The rise in policy loans at life insurance companies has moderated 
in the past month from the extremely high levels noted in the first 
third of the year. Life insurance companies would like to improve 
their liquidity and are not seeking new long-term investment 
outlets.
</p>, <p>Loan demand at large commercial banks appears to have eased 
somewhat, but this is not a universal view. Demand on the capital 
markets by corporations and municipalities continues to be intense. 
Little hope exists for lower interest rates in the near future, and 
some experts think the peak in long-term rates has not yet been 
reached.</p>, <p>It is becoming increasingly clear that output of nonelectrical 
machinery is declining. Manufacturers are ordering less equipment. 
Farm machinery sales continue poor. Construction machinery has been 
holding up fairly well at least for large pieces of equipment used 
in road building and heavy construction. Orders for capital goods 
components have dropped sharply in recent months.</p>, <p>Inventories of manufacturers generally do not appear to be 
excessive. Emphasis is placed on smaller shipments and rapid 
deliveries. In some cases, producers emphasize that distributors and 
dealers are working on a ""hand-to-mouth"" basis. Inventories of 
consumer hard goods, other than automobiles, have been reduced in 
line with lower sales since the start of the year.</p>, <p>The steel picture in the Chicago area is clouded by the truck 
strike, but output and orders have been holding up fairly well. 
Increasing competition in European markets has been associated with 
lower prices which, in turn, have reduced the incentive of Chicago 
area producers to sell in those markets. Foreign demand is expected 
to soften in the second half of 1970.</p>, <p>The rise in unemployment is expected to continue through the year, 
with some analysts expecting the national unemployment rate to 
reach, or exceed, 6 percent in late 1970 or early 1971. Some firms 
that had been allowing attrition to reduce their labor force rather 
than laying off workers have now begun to furlough workers. Many 
employers comment on the extremely sharp increase this year in the 
number of unsolicited summaries from job applicants with extensive 
experience.
</p>, <p>Domestic airline traffic in May and early June has continued below 
last year, despite the end of the controllers' strike. Pilots have 
been laid off, training of stewardesses has been reduced, equipment 
has been grounded, and profits (or losses) are ""near the disaster 
stage"". Air travel to foreign countries, in contrast, is extremely 
good, running about 30 percent above last year.</p>, <p>
Sales of passenger cars continue to be disappointing. Truck sales 
have failed to pick up with the settlement of the national truck 
strike, as had been expected. A long strike in the motor vehicle 
industry is taken as ""in the cards"" by most observers. </p>, <p>Many people still talk favorably of wage and price guidelines or 
controls, perhaps an immediate universal ""freeze"" but the 
difficulties of implementing such programs are widely understood, 
and most people appear to be thinking of the ""other guy's"" price or 
wages.</p>, <p class=""i9-c-footer__content--header"">

depressed level. There is little evidence that a general upturn is 
in progress, although most of the strike-related distortion seems to 
have been eliminated. In retail stores consumers appear to have 
become more price conscious,
but softness of demand is selective 
rather than general. 
The mood of our directors has recently shifted 
from cautious optimism to deep pessimism. They now believe that the 
current economic contraction will be more prolonged and deeper than 
most economists and public policy makers are currently expecting.</p>, <p>Recent terminations of strikes in the trucking and rubber industries 
resulted in a peaking in mid-May in the sharp rise in the District's 
insured unemployment rate. The rate has subsequently declined 
moderately although it remains roughly three times as large as the 
low point of last autumn. Our regular monthly survey of District 
manufacturers conducted during the first two weeks of June revealed 
further distortions caused by strikes and lockouts. Some of the 
major 
metal-producing and metal-working firms expect to be shipping 
in June partly from inventories that they were unable to ship in 
May. The survey accordingly showed an anticipated rebound in 
shipments and in employment during June, coupled with a sharp 
decline in inventories. Other anticipatory data for the current
month do not suggest an immediate general recovery in the District's 
manufacturing sector.</p>, <p>Discussion with an economist from a major department store chain 
doing nationwide business revealed that consumers have sharply 
curtailed their purchases of high-price luxury items and certain 
appliances. On the other hand, bargain basement business is 
extremely good for many items such as ready-made apparel. 
Confirmation of the fact that sales of big-ticket items 
(refrigerators, televisions, and other durable goods) have suffered 
came from one of our directors who is on the board of a major 
department store in Cleveland. Most of our directors, especially 
those associated with large industrial firms and banks, are now 
extremely pessimistic. They believe that real economic activity will 
show little, if any, recovery in the second half of 1970, and they 
are deeply concerned by their inability to counter labor's monopoly 
position in collective bargaining negotiations. A number of 
directors expressed reservations about the Administration's economic 
policies although most of them endorsed our current monetary policy 
of moderate growth in money and bank credit. There was a general 
feeling that senior executives in a broad range of industries shared 
this pessimism and were as a result lowering their sights for 
capital spending and employment.</p>, <p>One director who was formerly quite optimistic emphasized concern 
about growing weakness in new orders in his industry: auto and 
aircraft components. Another director representing a very large 
office equipment manufacturing firm reported that many firms were 
limiting or reducing expenditures for computers and related 
equipment and that he expected further cutbacks over the months 
immediately ahead.</p>, <p>The following comments were received about the machine tool 
industry, which is important in this District. A director who is the 
president of a substantial machine tool manufacturing firm mentioned 
that, although his competitors are experiencing a slowdown in new 
orders for machine tools, his company's business continues to be 
good. The chairman of a very large machine tool company 
headquartered in the District informed this Bank that, in contrast 
to poor domestic business, his company's plants in European 
countries are booking some 30 percent more orders than a year ago. 
An economist from another large machine tool company said he 
believed there was definite evidence that business has bottomed out 
in his firm, although he saw no signs of an upturn and did not 
expect one until after Labor Day. The same economist, who is highly 
regarded in the profession, volunteered the information that there 
is ""across-the-board weakness"" in his firm's prices. For example, 
prices of metal cutting machine tools, for which there are no 
official Bureau of Labor Statistics price data, are declining. 
Similar price reductions not reflected in the BLS data were reported 
by a director currently engaged in consulting work in the aluminum 
industry.</p>, <p>
Other comments of interest from the directors included mention of 
the fact that the supply situation in the coal industry is so tight 
that some utilities are currently importing coal at prices above 
domestic rates. A director from a large reserve city bank noted a 
recent sizable increase in business loans for current working 
capitalâ€”i.e., for ""paying the bills"". One director, the chairman of 
a large rubber company, reported a highly front-loaded labor 
compensation settlement for his firm. The contract calls for 
increases of 12 percent in the first year, 8 percent the second 
year, and 4 percent the third year.</p>, <p class=""i9-c-footer__content--header"">

</p>, <p>We strive to advance policy that promotes economic well-being.</p>, <p><a href=""/region-and-community/regional-economic-indicators/beige-book-archive"">â€¹ Back to Archive Search</a></p>, <p><strong>June 17, 1970</strong></p>, <p>Economic conditions in the Eleventh District resemble those for the 
nation as a whole. The slowdown in the pace of economic activity 
seems less pronounced in the District, however, than in the nation. 
Total employment is still edging upward in the District, and the 
value of construction contracts awarded during the first four months 
of 1970 is up sharply from the same period in 1969. The Texas 
industrial production index :has been trending irregularly downward, 
primarily owing to a drop in durables manufacturing. Bank credit and 
total deposits at the Eleventh District weekly reporting banks 
declined in May.</p>, <p>Despite the slowdown in economic activity in the District, inflation 
remains the major concern of businessmen and bankers for the rest of 
1970. This point emerged clearly in recent responses to 
questionnaires from both Head-Office and Branch-Office Board 
members. The Branch Board members further revealed an overall lack 
of confidence that monetary and fiscal policy would succeed in 
bringing inflation under control. They now favor the Federal 
Government's setting up some form of wage-price guidelines to be 
followed voluntarily by business.</p>, <p>Total nonagricultural employment in the five states of the District 
continued to increase in April, but the slim gain was less than 
seasonally expected. Manufacturing employment actually declined 
slightly in April. While widespread employment reductions are not 
evident in the District, job opportunities, in relation to the labor 
force, are not as plentiful as a year ago. The unemployment rate has 
increased, and in Texas, for example, initial unemployment insurance 
claims are almost twice as high as a year ago. These aggregate data 
tend to confirm the information given by Board members. Most of the 
Board members indicated that employment reductions were not 
anticipated in their industry, but a comparison of June responses 
with those received in May revealed some slight weakening in 
employment.</p>, <p>The seasonally adjusted Texas industrial production index declined 
in April from the March level and has generally trended downward in 
recent months.</p>, <p>The manufacturing sector, particularly durable goods manufacturing, 
has been the source of weakness in the production index. Petroleum 
mining and refining, however, remained at unusually high levels 
during the spring period, avoiding the usual seasonal decline. 
Petroleum stocks have built up to excessive levels recently, and the 
regulated oil production allowables in the District are generally 
lower for June than for May. This is likely to cause some further 
weakness in Texas industrial production this summer.</p>, <p>The value of construction contract awards declined in the District 
in April from the March level, but on a cumulative basis the 
January-April 1970 level is nearly one-third higher than in the same 
four months of 1969. The value of residential construction contracts 
so far this year has nearly matched the 1969 level, while 
nonresidential building and nonbuilding construction contracts are 
sharply higher than in the same four months a year ago. Responses of 
District Board members indicate that capital spending plans have not 
been curtailed in most of their firms. One Board member in June and 
one in May did report a substantial downward revision in plans for 
the current year. These capital spending plans are consistent with 
the view of most Board members that sales in their industry are 
either stabilizing or strengthening at the present time. 
Furthermore, nearly all the Board members report that corporate 
planning in their firms for 1971 is based on the expectation of a 
modest increase in sales and profits. Responses indicate that not a 
single Board member expects a decline in sales or profits for 1971.</p>, <p>Aggregate data opinions of Board members and responses of District 
retailers all confirm the observation that retail sales have been 
weak so far this year and the real volume of goods sold has probably 
declined. Sales of department stores in the District were very 
sluggish during the last two thirds of May, and in some weeks the 
current-dollar sales actually trailed the figure for the 
corresponding weeks a year ago. Department store sales improved 
noticeably, however, during the first week in June. Auto dealers in 
this District who were contacted recently indicated that the bottom 
of their <br/>
well-known sales decline may have been reached. Sales 
results for the first ten days of June indicated to most that the 
total monthly volume might equal or exceed that in June 1969.</p>, <p>The auto dealers contacted generally felt that their sales weakness 
was in total volume and that a noticeable shift in demand to lower 
priced or lesser equipped cars had not occurred. Nonautomotive 
retailers are noting some substitution of lower priced for higher 
priced merchandise. This observation was made mostly by department 
store managers, while more specialized retail establishments 
reported less shift toward lower priced merchandise. Of particular 
note was increased consumer attention on specials for specific items 
or on bargain basement merchandise rather than the regular stock.</p>, <p>Bank credit at District weekly reporting banks declined in May, as a 
result of reductions in both loans and securities holdings. Business 
loans fell further in May, following declines in each of the 
previous four months of 1970.
</p>, <p>Total deposits at the weekly reporting banks also declined in May, 
caused mainly by a drop in demand deposits, much of which 
represented reduced holdings by the United States Government. 
Discount window borrowings and net purchases of Federal funds by the 
Eleventh District member banks also declined in May.</p>, <p class=""i9-c-footer__content--header"">

plateau. Local activity is stronger where the economy has been 
experiencing a strong growth situation. The agricultural picture 
also continues to be favorable. At the same time, construction 
slowdowns, reduced defense activity, and labor strikes have slowed 
the economies of some areas. The residential construction industry 
continues to be plagued with a lack of mortgage financing. The 
construction industry also exemplifies the deeply imbedded impact of 
inflation, as may be noted by some current wage demands in the 
industry.</p>, <p>District retail sales, as indicated by selected larger merchants, 
are fair and in a few geographical areas good. Retailing for May and 
early June is running somewhat ahead of the same period a year ago; 
however, the dollar gain is not as large as the increase in prices, 
so that real volume is down somewhat. The only merchandise that is 
selling at lower prices is ladies' ready-to-wear, which reflects the 
need to move heavy inventories of styles being obsoleted.</p>, <p>There is some evidence that the average unit of sale has increased 
in size: there are fewer customers, and they are making larger total 
purchases. No evidence was uncovered among major department stores 
indicating that customers were downgrading quality in their 
purchases. Rather it seems that customers with higher and more 
stable income prospects have become relatively more important and 
are maintaining quality levels. Persons with reduced income 
prospects are limiting purchases to necessities.</p>, <p>Advance reservations at important winter recreation areas are 
reported to be slow, indicating that consumers are hesitant to make 
these longer-term commitments. This contrasts with a strong upward 
trend in this consumer activity during recent years. Special 
economic circumstances are having important effects on sales in some 
areas. For example, while retail volume in Kansas City has held up 
quite well to this point, merchants are increasingly noting the 
effect of the construction strike which is now 2 1/2 months old.</p>, <p>The construction industry situation in Kansas City is serious, and 
it may have implications well beyond the immediate area. Kansas City 
last year lost more man-days from strikes than any other area of the 
country. This year the laborers, whose current wage rate is $4.01 
per hour, are asking for an increase of $4.00 per hour now and a 
total increase of $6.00 over three years.</p>, <p>Construction activity reflects a variety of local situations in the 
context of national financial markets and Federal programs. Highway 
construction generally is active throughout the District. Commercial 
construction is strong in some areas where it reflects urban renewal 
projects as well as other building, particularly office buildings. 
Current and anticipated construction of new factories and plants is 
weak throughout the District. Despite strong demand for housing in 
many areas, new construction of dwellings is slow throughout the 
District because of difficulty in obtaining financing.</p>, <p>The agricultural sector continues to add strength to District 
economic activity. Cash receipts from farm marketings during the 
first quarter of this year averaged a fifth higher, compared with 
the favorable levels of the comparable period of last year. Although 
this rate of increase is not likely to be maintained, all 
indications point toward a substantial improvement over last year's 
record-high levels of farm receipts. In addition to receipts from 
the sale of a good wheat crop which is now being harvested, income 
from livestock sales remains more favorable than was expected. It 
also should be pointed out that payments under the various 
Government farm programs will be made differently this year, 
compared with other recent years. Payments on wheat certificates, 
feed grain programs, and the cotton<br/>
programâ€”which are likely to 
approach three quarters of a billion dollarsâ€”will be made largely 
during the next two months. These payments, amounting to about 10 
percent of total cash receipts from farm marketings in the District, 
will add substantially to the volume of funds in District banks. 
These favorable income prospects for agriculture have been 
responsible for relatively high levels of economic activity in rural 
areas, even though many marginal farmers are discontinuing 
operations.</p>, <p class=""i9-c-footer__content--header"">

very concerned about the persistence of inflationary pressures and 
seem to be willing to try almost anything, including wage-price 
guidelines, to control the problem. District investment firms are 
encountering financial difficulties and, as a result, have had to 
alter their operations. Businesses are continuing to cut back their 
investment plans, and scattered instances suggest that consumers may 
be changing their consumption patterns because of the uncertainty 
regarding the state of the economy.</p>, <p>During the go-around at the last meeting of the Board of Directors 
of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, the directors were asked 
whether or not business and union leaders in their local areas would 
support some kind of incomes policy or wage-price guidelines. They 
felt that people are becoming increasingly concerned about inflation 
and are becoming progressively disenchanted with traditional 
restrictive monetary and fiscal policies. As a result, the directors 
felt that guidelines would probably be publicly unpopular but in 
many cases would be privately welcomed. In general, they thought 
that people would prefer to see voluntary controls imposed rather 
than new legislation, and that businessmen are more in favor of 
guidelines than labor leaders. The directors cited a number of
instances where business leaders have voiced approval of some kind 
of guidelines. The directors also cited cases where labor leaders 
did not want to be quoted but were concerned with the large 
settlements which have been won by unions in recent labor disputes. 
Because of these large settlements, rank and file members are 
expecting large wage increases and union leaders are afraid to ask 
for less. Guidelines would give them an excuse to argue for lower 
wage settlements. </p>, <p>The financial difficulties being experienced by Wall Street 
investment bankers, mutual funds, and securities dealers are 
apparently also being encountered by Ninth District investment 
firms. A telephone poll of two leading local investment banking 
firms explored the implications of these problems in three areas of 
their operations. First, operating staffs of securities brokers have 
been cut back about 15 to 20 percent in the last year. These 
cutbacks, however, were attributed to the decline in volume of 
trading rather than to the current financial crisis. In general, 
sales staffs have been reduced, with the declines occurring in some 
instances through attrition rather than through layoffs. Second, a 
securities brokerage house is closing one of its suburban offices 
because of the lack of volume. In addition, a director was aware of 
a mutual fund in Billings, Montana, which has recently closed down. 
Third, merger activity among securities brokers appears to be on the 
upswing. Both investment bankers who were contacted reported that 
they had been approached by a number of smaller firms in the last 
three months. Although only two mergers have been consummated, these 
firms felt that additional mergers could take place in the not-too-distant future.</p>, <p>Scattered pieces of information continue to show that District 
manufacturers are cutting back their capital expenditure plans. Two 
directors cited cases where distributors of heavy equipment to 
agriculture and construction firms have experienced sharp declines 
in sales during the past month or so. It was also reported that a 
large retail firm headquartered in the twin cities has cut back its 
capital appropriations by about 50 percent. One other director 
stated that General Motors has scheduled huge cutbacks in capital 
spending, with each division being asked to curtail capital 
expenditures.</p>, <p>A number of examples have come to light which suggest that consumers 
are changing their consumption patterns. A Minneapolis-based 
undergarment manufacturer reports that its sales are 10 to 15 
percent below last year's levels. They attribute their poor sales 
performance this year to the slowdown in department store sales and 
feel that consumers are taking their business to lower priced 
stores. Automobile dealers in the twin cities report a downturn in 
auto sales which has been centered primarily in higher priced 
automobiles and that sales of basic models are holding up fairly 
well. In addition, repair shops for both automobiles and other 
durable goods are experiencing sharp increases in business, which 
suggest that consumers are tending to hold off on major durables 
purchases. A telephone pol1 of resorts around the District reveals 
that resort owners are experiencing a number of cancellations, 
although accommodations at Yellowstone and Glacier National Parks 
are still very tight. All the resort owners who were contacted said 
that they could accept reservations for any time this summer.</p>, <p class=""i9-c-footer__content--header"">
