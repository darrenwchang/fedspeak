However, customer \\r\\nresistance to higher priced brands has increased, with lower priced \\r\\nmerchandise receiving the benefit. A canvass of merchants by one of \\r\\nour Branch offices indicated that they expect no improvement in \\r\\nsales within the near future. Regarding auto sales, distributors \\r\\ncontacted report some shifting from larger cars to the compact \\r\\nsized, loaded with optional equipment. Rather than settling for a \\r\\nstripped-down version of a full-sized car, customers are purchasing \\r\\nlower priced equipment-packed models.], [[Belt tightening], [], \\r\\n A profit squeeze is causing many businesses to trim \\r\\nfat wherever possible. Reports of capital expenditures being reduced \\r\\nor stretched out have been coming from several sources.

A large \\r\\nsteel producer in Alabama and a large aluminum company in Tennessee \\r\\nare reportedly cutting employment by as much as 20 percent. A \\r\\nMississippi furniture manufacturer is reported to be trimming \\r\\nemployment from 2,800 to 1,700. A 500-man cutback is imminent at \\r\\nanother firm, and a District bank is cutting employmentâ€”this one by \\r\\n10 percent across the board. A regional airline is cutting its work \\r\\nforce by 100, \"purely as an economy move\".

Their \\r\\ncomments, as given below, are separated on the basis of real versus \\r\\nmonetary markets.], [[Monetary Conditions and Capital Markets], [], \\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Otto Eckstein characterized capital markets as currently \\r\\nbeing in a \"most unusual state\", attributing this to (1) the \\r\\nSystem's switch to aggregate targets, (2) the continuing high rate \\r\\nof inflation and suspicion that it will not abate, and (3) \\r\\nuncertainties wrought by Cambodia andâ€”particularlyâ€”the stock \\r\\nmarket. With respect to the Fed's current stance, Eckstein \\r\\nemphatically pointed out that policy can be judged as having been \\r\\neasier over the last few months only by a monetarist's standards. \\r\\nMeasured from any starting month previous to February 1970, the \\r\\nwidely touted 10 percent annual growth rate of money stock shrinks \\r\\nto 3 to 5 percent. On top of this moderate rate of growth, Eckstein \\r\\ninterprets the events of April and May as having led to a greatly \\r\\nincreased liquidity preference on the part of the public, concluding \\r\\nthat endorsement of a 4 percent rate of monetary growth during the \\r\\ncurrent period is \"really somewhat cavalier\".], [Professor James Tobin concurred with Eckstein on this view of System \\r\\npolicy, additionally pointing out that with a 4 or 5 percent rate of \\r\\ngrowth, money supply is shrinking in real terms. Tobin also voiced \\r\\nfears that the Fed's excessively tight policy in combination with \\r\\nits shift to aggregate targets has forced interest rates to a point \\r\\nwell above the real rate of return on capital, a state of affairs he \\r\\nfeels will depress real activity more than we are bargaining for.], [At the opposite end of the spectrum was Professor Henry Wallich, who \\r\\nstated that Fed policy is threatening to become overly easy \"no \\r\\nmatter how money stock is measured\".], [\\r\\nViews varied also on the causes and the implications of the stock \\r\\nmarket decline. Wallich feels the principal explanation is the \\r\\nnecessary, but painful, adjustment of equity markets to a 9 percent \\r\\nbond market. Tobin, on the other hand, feels the decline has been \\r\\nserious, stating that it will have both wealth and cost of capital \\r\\neffects, and that it is symptomatic of a general economic malaise. \\r\\nWhen viewed from the more regional, micro outlook of our banking \\r\\ndirectors, money market conditions appeared more optimistic. Only a \\r\\nmonth ago all three of our Class A directors were reporting \\r\\ncommercial loan demands at an all-time high at their respective \\r\\ninstitutions. Two now report that this situation has moderated to a \\r\\ndegree where their banks can handle it. Our directors also report a \\r\\nhealthy pickup in deposit inflows over the last three weeks in all \\r\\ncategories, but particularly in consumer-type deposits. Mr. Kennedy \\r\\nnoted that for the first time in 1970, deposit figures at his \\r\\ninstitution are now exceeding year-ago levels. Taken together, these \\r\\nfactors represent a substantial shift toward optimism among our \\r\\nbanking directors from a month ago.], [[GNP and Real Market Aggregates], [], \\r\\n\\r\\nOur academicians shifted positions in their discussion of the \\r\\noutlook in real markets, with Eckstein becoming the most bullish. He \\r\\nsees the economy currently hovering between recession and no growth, \\r\\nbut remains convinced that most of the GNP markdown will occur in \\r\\nthe first half of this year. While he hasn't made a run on his model \\r\\nfor about three weeks now, he sees total 1970 GNP falling in the \\r\\n$982-$985 billion range, with unemployment at 5.0 to 5.2 percent by \\r\\nthe year-end. Eckstein further offered the opinion that, if we do \\r\\nhave a recession (however measured), it will be far and away the \\r\\nmildest of the postwar period.], [Wallich similarly sees 1970 nominal GNP winding up in the $980-$985 \\r\\nbillion range, with a nominal fourth-quarter gain of about $15 \\r\\nbillion. While he identified unemployment, prices, and interest \\r\\nrates as all behaving worse than expected, he expressed confidence \\r\\nthat the nominal GNP forecasts made earlier this year will hold up \\r\\nquite well. Noting how successive capital surveys have shown a \\r\\nconsistency, he does not feel that capital expenditure plans are \\r\\ncollapsing, and he sees the possibility of bringing the GNP deflator \\r\\ndown to a level of 4 percent by the year-end. On the outlook for \\r\\nunemployment in the third and fourth quarters, he was somewhat more \\r\\nbearish than Eckstein.], [Tobin once again provided the most gloomy assessment, predicting \\r\\nunemployment will rise to at least 5 1/2 percent by the year-end, \\r\\nand very possibly higher. He did not provide us with GNP projections \\r\\nfor the next two quarters.], [Again turning to the micro-oriented views of our directors, the \\r\\npicture is quite mixed. Mr. Robertson of the Bangor Punta Corp. \\r\\n(aircraft firearms, recreational equipment, farm products, etc.) \\r\\nreports that sales are continuing a sharp deterioration in nearly \\r\\nall their lines, with the one major exception the capital goods \\r\\nproduced in their process engineering division. Their layoffs have \\r\\nbeen substantial, and capital expenditure plans have been cut back \\r\\n30 to 40 percent. Other directors, however, noted that layoffs seem \\r\\nto have subsided in their areas. Messrs. Cabot (Cabot Corp.) and \\r\\nCarter (Nashua Corp.) report their capital expenditure plans are \\r\\ncontinuing at or near the levels originally planned, althoughâ€”apropos of Tobin's point aboveâ€”Mr. Carter did note that their \\r\\ncapital spending is becoming increasingly contingent upon securing \\r\\nreasonably priced financing. Other queries to our directors produced \\r\\nno shift in sentiment from the views they expressed a month ago.], [\\r\\n                            We serve the public by pursuing a growing economy and stable financial system that work for all of us., [\\n]]]</td>\n",

Responses of \\r\\nDistrict Board members indicate that capital spending plans have not \\r\\nbeen curtailed in most of their firms. One Board member in June and \\r\\none in May did report a substantial downward revision in plans for \\r\\nthe current year. These capital spending plans are consistent with \\r\\nthe view of most Board members that sales in their industry are \\r\\neither stabilizing or strengthening at the present time. \\r\\nFurthermore, nearly all the Board members report that corporate \\r\\nplanning in their firms for 1971 is based on the expectation of a \\r\\nmodest increase in sales and profits. Responses indicate that not a \\r\\nsingle Board member expects a decline in sales or profits for 1971.], [Aggregate data opinions of Board members and responses of District \\r\\nretailers all confirm the observation that retail sales have been \\r\\nweak so far this year and the real volume of goods sold has probably \\r\\ndeclined. Sales of department stores in the District were very \\r\\nsluggish during the last two thirds of May, and in some weeks the \\r\\ncurrent-dollar sales actually trailed the figure for the \\r\\ncorresponding weeks a year ago. Department store sales improved \\r\\nnoticeably, however, during the first week in June.

Nonautomotive \\r\\nretailers are noting some substitution of lower priced for higher \\r\\npriced merchandise. This observation was made mostly by department \\r\\nstore managers, while more specialized retail establishments \\r\\nreported less shift toward lower priced merchandise. Of particular \\r\\nnote was increased consumer attention on specials for specific items \\r\\nor on bargain basement merchandise rather than the regular stock.], [Bank credit at District weekly reporting banks declined in May, as a \\r\\nresult of reductions in both loans and securities holdings. Business \\r\\nloans fell further in May, following declines in each of the \\r\\nprevious four months of 1970.\\r\\n], [Total deposits at the weekly reporting banks also declined in May, \\r\\ncaused mainly by a drop in demand deposits, much of which \\r\\nrepresented reduced holdings by the United States Government. \\r\\nDiscount window borrowings and net purchases of Federal funds by the \\r\\nEleventh District member banks also declined in May.], [\\r\\n                            We serve the public by pursuing a growing economy and stable financial system that work for all of us., [\\n]]]</td>\n",

At the same time, there is little optimism that inflation \\r\\nwill be brought under control quickly. Consumer demand continues to \\r\\nbe high, although sales are somewhat slower than last year, and \\r\\nthere is continued demand upon banks for credit. The adverse effects \\r\\nof the slowdown appear in two principal forms. Unemployment is seen \\r\\nto be much higher this year, and many firms report experiencing a \\r\\nprofit squeeze. They say that they are unable to offset by price \\r\\nincreases or greater sales volume their higher costs. In \\r\\nconsequence, they are attempting to cut expenses by reducing staffs, \\r\\ncutting inventories, and delaying capital protects.], [Unemployment has risen in most parts of the District. The highest \\r\\nlevels are in the Pacific Northwest where the principal problems are \\r\\ncentered in the lumber industry and Boeing Aircraft. Boeing is the \\r\\nprincipal employer in the Seattle-Tacoma area, and it has cut its \\r\\nemployment from over 100,000 in 1968 to 58,000 now, with further \\r\\nlayoffs announced for the rest of this year to reduce the level to \\r\\n43,000. Lumber operations have been at a reduced pace throughout \\r\\nmuch of Washington and Oregon. Apparently the smaller mills are \\r\\nbearing the major burden, while the large integrated mills continue \\r\\nto maintain production. There is some expectation of a recovery, at \\r\\nleast in Oregon, toward the end of the year. The other area with a \\r\\nmajor unemployment problem is southern California, where the \\r\\naffected industries are aerospace and, to a less extent, housing.], [Construction of new residential housing and the opening of new \\r\\nsubdivisions continue to be slow. The decline in demand is heaviest \\r\\nin the Seattle area because of the layoffs at Boeing. The principal \\r\\nstrength is in commercial construction. This is certainly the case \\r\\nin California where commercial building remains high. In many cases \\r\\nthere is also a strong demand for mobile homes. This particular \\r\\nchange may be part of a tendency for consumers to downgrade the \\r\\nquality of their housing demand.\\r\\n], [Retail sales remain relatively steady despite the rising \\r\\nunemployment, and they continue to be a source of strength in most \\r\\nareas. For most kinds of consumer goods, there is no sign of \\r\\ndowngrading in choice of items as a means of economizing. Consumers \\r\\nare reported to be more careful in watching for and responding to \\r\\nsales, but there is no pronounced shift to lower grade goods. When \\r\\npurchases of major appliances are made, the demand is still for the \\r\\n\\r\\n  higher-grade line. Replies from major department stores indicate the \\r\\ngeneral composition of their business is not changed, although sales \\r\\nare not rising at last year's pace.], [There is one major exception to this picture. Reports from \\r\\nthroughout the District indicate that consumers are economizing on \\r\\ntheir automobile purchases. They are shifting away from middle-line \\r\\nmodels to lower priced and foreign economy cars, although luxury car \\r\\ndemand remains high. As part of this shift, there appears to be an \\r\\nincreased demand for late model used cars. Therefore, there is \\r\\nevidence of both a reduction of automobile purchases and a \\r\\ndowngrading of quality of purchases.], [The recent decline in the stock market has not had any noticeable \\r\\nimpact on consumer purchases, but it does seem to contribute toward \\r\\ncreating more general uncertainty on the part of businessmen. One \\r\\nspecific example of the effect of lower stock prices reported is \\r\\nthose cases where stock had been used as loan collateral and the \\r\\nborrowers were forced to sell at a loss to cover the loan.], [Many businesses report that their profit margins are being narrowed \\r\\nby higher costs, especially labor costs and by an inability to raise \\r\\ntheir revenue. Sales are not rising to offset the costs, and general \\r\\nprice increases are not always feasible. In consequence, there is \\r\\nmore emphasis upon cost reductions. This takes various forms: closer \\r\\ncontrols over inventories, increased layoffs of employees, and in \\r\\nsome cases postponement of capital projects. In fact, one of the \\r\\nclearest responses of individual businesses to this combination of \\r\\nsmaller profit margins and continued high interest rates appears in \\r\\nthe reduction of capital spending. One large oil company, for \\r\\nexample, describes its projects as being continuously reviewed, and \\r\\nseveral other manufacturing companies report a postponement and \\r\\nreduction of planned expenditures.], [Financial pressures are also an element in the slowing of business \\r\\ncapital expenditures. Several companies reported credit stringency \\r\\nand high interest costs as factors leading to a revision in their \\r\\nplans. In one case, foreign financial conditions caused difficulties \\r\\nfor one company; foreign banks were unable to supply funds normally \\r\\nutilized by this business. Financial conditions continue to be cited \\r\\nas an important adverse factor influencing the construction \\r\\nindustry. This is in spite of deliberate efforts by banks to \\r\\nallocate funds to meet this demand.

Thus, he concludes the system \\r\\nshould reasonably pursue a 6 percent rate of money stock growth over \\r\\nthe rest of 1970. Professor Otto Eckstein concurs in this outlook \\r\\nfor GNP, now forecasting $982 billion for the year. He feels that \\r\\nrecent developments have largely offset each other in terms of \\r\\noverall economic impact. On the negative side, he attaches \\r\\nimportance to the decline in construction contracts and the sharp \\r\\ndrop in prime defense contracts. He further expects manufacturing \\r\\ninvestment to be well under current levels next year. On the plus \\r\\nside, however, are the final cessation of the truck strike, the \\r\\nturnaround in auto sales, and the largest jump in history in utility \\r\\nappropriations.], [The one major difference between Wallich and Eckstein seems to be \\r\\ntheir outlook on the future course of unemployment rates. A month \\r\\nago, Professor Wallich cautiously suggested we might reach 5-1/2 \\r\\npercent by year-end. He now is suggesting that something in the \\r\\nrange of 5-1/2 to 6 percent seems quite likely. Professor Eckstein, \\r\\non the other hand, looks for very little more than 5 percent \\r\\nunemployment by the end of this year, with 5-1/2 percent not being \\r\\nreached until the end of 1971, if at all. Using Okun's law, Eckstein \\r\\npoints out that a year-end figure of 6 percent unemployment implies \\r\\nan increase in the GNP gap of 3 percent over the next two quarters, \\r\\na prospect which he considers very unlikely.], [\\r\\n                            We serve the public by pursuing a growing economy and stable financial system that work for all of us., [\\n]]]</td>\n",

The \\r\\ntwo reasons that were most often cited for this lack of job \\r\\nopportunities were that construction and tourism, the two major \\r\\nactivities in the district where students usually find work, are \\r\\noperating at lower levels than in the past few years; and a number \\r\\nof employers who are facing squeezes on profits and liquidity are \\r\\nnot hiring summer help as freely as they did in previous summers.], [A number of additional cases which indicate that consumers are \\r\\ndowngrading the quality of their purchases have come to our \\r\\nattention in the past month.

A major Minneapolis scientific instrument and \\r\\nordnance manufacturer, for example, reduced its original increase in \\r\\ncapital spending plans by 20 per cent.

They add, \\r\\nhowever, that this is not the result of larger inflows of savings, \\r\\nbut instead reflects the slowdown in demand for such credit. \\r\\nBuilders report little demand for large homes.], [Although the prospects for business expansion and new plant \\r\\nconstruction have declined in St. Louis and other large Eighth \\r\\nDistrict centers, expansion continues at a healthy pace in the \\r\\noutlying areas, especially in the southern portion of the District \\r\\nwhere earnings of smaller companies continue at satisfactory levels.], [The outlook for agriculture is mixed. Cattle feeders in the Eighth \\r\\nDistrict are making little or no profit. Hogs have been profitable \\r\\nduring the past year, but the prospects for the rest of this year \\r\\nand early next year are less promising. Although broilers are \\r\\nunprofitable at the moment, the situation can change rather rapidly \\r\\nfor broiler producers. Egg and milk producers are doing quite well. \\r\\nCrops are very late and much land was not planted, but with a late \\r\\nfrost a high level of crop production is still possible.], [Prices of meat and other livestock products are likely to average \\r\\nsomewhat lower in the year ahead than in the past twelve months, \\r\\npointing to somewhat less upward pressure on food prices.], [\\r\\n                            We serve the public by pursuing a growing economy and stable financial system that work for all of us., [\\n]]]</td>\n",

Nevertheless, no instances were \\r\\nfound in which this had yet led to a curtailment of capital \\r\\nexpenditure plans for the rest of 1970, and corroborating evidence \\r\\nof this is found in the observation of three different commercial \\r\\nbankers that business loan demand had risen to historic highs in the \\r\\nlast week or two at their institutions.

Such weakness as was reported seems concentrated in \\r\\ncorporate CDs and individual demand deposits.

Widespread campus disturbances in \\r\\nthe District have forced a number of universities to close and \\r\\nundoubtedly have had an adverse impact on business conditions in \\r\\nlocal areas. This Bank's regular monthly survey of about 70 large \\r\\nmanufacturing companies in the District reflected the softening in \\r\\nnationwide industrial activity last fall and early winter. Signs of \\r\\na bottoming were evidenced in the survey taken in April, but the May \\r\\nsurvey revealed sharp setbacks during the month of April in key \\r\\nseries such as new orders and shipments and a marked deterioration \\r\\nin employment and the workweek, presumably because of work \\r\\nstoppages. The District's insured unemployment rate, which had been \\r\\nedging moderately upward (from 1 percent last October to 2 percent \\r\\nin late March), jumped one percentage point during April to 3 \\r\\npercent.], [At a meeting of about 40 business economists, held at the Bank on \\r\\nMay 15, there were mixed reports concerning recent price behavior. \\r\\nThe majority maintained that wage-cost pressures, in the face of \\r\\nslack demand, are so great as to make it easy to \"pass on\" higher \\r\\nprices. Some economists, however, reported \"under the table\" \\r\\ndiscounting and price rebates, which presumably are not being \\r\\nrecorded in the official price indexes. Specifically, an economist \\r\\nfrom a major rubber company said his firm's price index for tires, \\r\\nbased on actual transactions prices and reflecting the mix of \\r\\nconsumer purchases, had risen during the past year only about , [], \\r\\none-third as much as the BLS price index for tires. Economists from the \\r\\nchemical industries reported recent weakness in chemical prices and \\r\\nnoted that few chemical products were selling at list prices.], [Other points of interest emerging from the meeting included a report \\r\\nby an economist from a large machine tool company in Cleveland that \\r\\nhis firm was living off backlogs, that business booked in April was \\r\\nonly one-quarter of what they would normally receive at this time of \\r\\nthe year, and that they had not yet booked a single new order in \\r\\nMay. Economists from two major auto companies believed the worst of \\r\\nthe cutback in new car sales and production was over and that, \\r\\nfollowing leveling tendencies in the second and third quarters, \\r\\nsales would recover later in the year. Economists from the steel \\r\\nindustry expect the current favorable trade balance in steel to \\r\\ndeteriorate later in the year, with a strong increase in imports and \\r\\nan easing in exports. On the other hand, the steel industry should \\r\\nsoon begin to feel the effects of hedge buying in anticipation of a \\r\\npossible strike next year.], [Among the comments received from this Bank's directors at a joint \\r\\nboard meeting held on May 14, there were reports that markets for \\r\\nauto components and consumer electronics are becoming softer. One \\r\\ndirector said that one industry in which his firm is a major factor, \\r\\nflat glass, isâ€”and would remainâ€”in the doldrums until auto \\r\\nproduction and construction show improvement, but he was not \\r\\noptimistic. Several directors emphasized that the demand for coal is \\r\\nthe greatest since World War II; stockpiles are low and there is \\r\\ndifficulty in receiving supplies.

One director, \\r\\nthe dean of a graduate school, reported that this year's graduates \\r\\nare harder to place.

A recession is \\r\\nconsidered possible by a number of the board members, but this \\r\\nprospect is causing less concern than inflation since there is a \\r\\nwidespread belief among the directors that a recession would be \\r\\nshort and mild. A liquidity crisis is mentioned as a possibility by \\r\\nonly one-third of the respondents, and the odds attached to this \\r\\noutcome are relatively low. With this overall economic outlook, the \\r\\nboard members expected sales to show no increase or only a small \\r\\nincrease in 1970, while profits are expected to decline. One \\r\\ndirector thought there might be a fall of more than 5 percent in \\r\\nboth sales and profits.], [Every board member reported that employee wages in their firms were \\r\\nbeing increased in 1970. This direct experience with higher wage \\r\\ncosts may be one reason for the almost unanimous concern with \\r\\ninflation, ahead of other economic problems. The smallest wage \\r\\nincrease (4 percent) was cited by an academic leader, while the \\r\\nlargest (10 percent) was mentioned by a banker. The nonbanking \\r\\nbusinessmen mentioned 6 percent most often as the wage adjustment \\r\\nthey were making this year.], [The respondents were unanimous in their view that the Federal budget \\r\\nwould operate with a deficit this year. Apparently, the \\r\\nAdministration's forecast of a budget surplus is not accepted within \\r\\nthe business and financial community, although a few directors \\r\\nthought the deficit might be small.], [Despite some concern about a mild recession, acknowledgment of \\r\\nhigher labor costs, and a generally poor outlook for profits this \\r\\nyear, there were no reports of employment cutbacks by the bankers \\r\\nand businessmen interviewed and no indication that employment cuts \\r\\nwere currently being considered. In fact, plans for very modest \\r\\nexpansion of the labor force were noted by a couple of respondents. \\r\\nThis reported maintenance of employment levels is consistent with \\r\\nthe aggregate data for the Eleventh District, which show total \\r\\nemployment still edging upward. The increase in employment, however, \\r\\nhas not been sufficient to absorb all of the new labor force \\r\\nentrants in the District states. Thus, there has been an increase in \\r\\nunemployment in the Eleventh District since the end of 1969, and \\r\\nunemployment insurance activity is at a considerably higher level.], [The respondents to our survey did note some softening in planned \\r\\nplant and equipment spending. More than half indicated that their \\r\\nJanuary expectations had been revised downward; the estimates of the \\r\\nmagnitude of the downward revision were vague but apparently \\r\\nindicated, in most cases, trimming around the edges rather than \\r\\nwholesale slashing.

Construction contract activity in the District showed \\r\\nrenewed strength in the first quarter of 1970, compared with either \\r\\nthe year-earlier period or the fourth quarter of 1969. Nonbuilding \\r\\nconstruction contracts were up considerably, buoyed by two very \\r\\nlarge contracts; nonresidential contracts also showed a sizable \\r\\nincrease. A seasonal expansion in construction employment has \\r\\noccurred this spring, although the gain came earlier and was \\r\\nsomewhat less than usual.], [Department store sales in the Eleventh District through early May \\r\\nwere up moderately in dollar value, but less than the amount \\r\\nrequired to offset inflation. Sales in early May appeared somewhat \\r\\nstronger than has been the case for the year as a whole so far.], [Agricultural activities throughout most of the Eleventh District are \\r\\nprogressing under generally favorable weather conditions. Cash \\r\\nreceipts from farm marketings in the District states were up \\r\\nsubstantially in the first two months of 1970, compared with year-earlier levels.], [Loan demand in the Eleventh District remained sluggish in April, as \\r\\ntotal loans at weekly reporting commercial banks declined \\r\\ncontraseasonally. With both time and savings deposits increasing, \\r\\nDistrict banks added considerably to their holdings of securities, \\r\\nparticularly municipals.

Perhaps the most pervasive comments revolve about \\r\\nconstruction industry wage settlements. The extremely high national \\r\\nrate of wage increase is mirrored in the District, but of more \\r\\nsignificance, current and emerging wage demands will probably give a \\r\\nnew lift to the national spiral. Construction is at a standstill in \\r\\nsome areas of the District, as new wage bargaining proceeds. \\r\\nExcessive increases in construction costs are an important part of \\r\\nthe reason for the reduced volume of new construction awards, which \\r\\nwill show up in reduced construction activity six months or so \\r\\nhence. Even now, it is reported, there is a virtual absence of small \\r\\nconstruction projects of $750,000 or less.], [The magnitude of wage increases in construction, and in other \\r\\nindustries as well, is causing many to doubt the validity of \\r\\nattempting to bring wage-cost inflation under control by monetary \\r\\nand fiscal policies. There is a strong belief that stabilization \\r\\ngoals can be accomplished only if the unbridled power of labor \\r\\nunions is curbed. In this connection, it was noted that some local \\r\\nmemberships in their push for large gains have effectively \\r\\noverthrown the guidance of national leaders. It was interesting, \\r\\ntoo, to hear that the top construction company in the United States \\r\\nlast year is a nonunion firm.], [Retail sales are reported in the range of from firm to down by \\r\\nvarying amounts. Where sales were reported weak, it was indicated \\r\\nthat the public is deeply concerned about the prospect of recession.], [Despite excellent production prospects, producers of farm crops are \\r\\ndiscouraged by low prices for many of these crops. Bankers in the \\r\\nHigh Plains report that increasing numbers of farmers, particularly \\r\\nwheat farmers, are quitting because of low prices and restricted \\r\\naverage allotment programs. The attrition appears to be \\r\\nsubstantially higher than the average for other recent years caused \\r\\nby the changing structure of the industry. The livestock sector \\r\\ncontinues to remain relatively favorable. However, the impact of \\r\\nhigher livestock prices is expected to be offset by increasing \\r\\ncosts, resulting in little change in net farm income measured in \\r\\ncurrent dollars. Consequently, net farm income measured in real \\r\\nterms is likely to be down.], [The 8-percent increase in net farm income in 1969, combined with \\r\\nefforts of farm producers to increase efficiency by going to larger \\r\\nequipment and other technological improvements, has caused purchases \\r\\nby farmers to increase. Farm machinery dealers report sales of farm \\r\\nequipment to be unusually good. They are fearful, however, that to a \\r\\nconsiderable extent current sales are being made at the expense of \\r\\nnormal future sales. Conversation with farm purchasers indicates \\r\\nthat they are buying now because they expect equipment prices to \\r\\nrise substantially as new union contracts are negotiated.

The other industrialist expected no further declines in \\r\\nthe volume of business. He indicated, though, that he was less \\r\\ncertain about the economy and more confused now than at anytime in \\r\\nhis experience. Further, this industrialist is skeptical about the \\r\\nability of current policy to make much headway against inflation.], [All board members expressed concern over declines in the stock \\r\\nmarket.

The\\r\\nwage-push \\r\\nproblem is particularly acute in the construction industries.

Their \\r\\ncomments, as given below, are separated on the basis of real versus \\r\\nmonetary markets.], [[Monetary Conditions and Capital Markets], [], \\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Otto Eckstein characterized capital markets as currently \\r\\nbeing in a \"most unusual state\", attributing this to (1) the \\r\\nSystem's switch to aggregate targets, (2) the continuing high rate \\r\\nof inflation and suspicion that it will not abate, and (3) \\r\\nuncertainties wrought by Cambodia andâ€”particularlyâ€”the stock \\r\\nmarket. With respect to the Fed's current stance, Eckstein \\r\\nemphatically pointed out that policy can be judged as having been \\r\\neasier over the last few months only by a monetarist's standards. \\r\\nMeasured from any starting month previous to February 1970, the \\r\\nwidely touted 10 percent annual growth rate of money stock shrinks \\r\\nto 3 to 5 percent. On top of this moderate rate of growth, Eckstein \\r\\ninterprets the events of April and May as having led to a greatly \\r\\nincreased liquidity preference on the part of the public, concluding \\r\\nthat endorsement of a 4 percent rate of monetary growth during the \\r\\ncurrent period is \"really somewhat cavalier\".], [Professor James Tobin concurred with Eckstein on this view of System \\r\\npolicy, additionally pointing out that with a 4 or 5 percent rate of \\r\\ngrowth, money supply is shrinking in real terms. Tobin also voiced \\r\\nfears that the Fed's excessively tight policy in combination with \\r\\nits shift to aggregate targets has forced interest rates to a point \\r\\nwell above the real rate of return on capital, a state of affairs he \\r\\nfeels will depress real activity more than we are bargaining for.], [At the opposite end of the spectrum was Professor Henry Wallich, who \\r\\nstated that Fed policy is threatening to become overly easy \"no \\r\\nmatter how money stock is measured\".], [\\r\\nViews varied also on the causes and the implications of the stock \\r\\nmarket decline. Wallich feels the principal explanation is the \\r\\nnecessary, but painful, adjustment of equity markets to a 9 percent \\r\\nbond market. Tobin, on the other hand, feels the decline has been \\r\\nserious, stating that it will have both wealth and cost of capital \\r\\neffects, and that it is symptomatic of a general economic malaise. \\r\\nWhen viewed from the more regional, micro outlook of our banking \\r\\ndirectors, money market conditions appeared more optimistic. Only a \\r\\nmonth ago all three of our Class A directors were reporting \\r\\ncommercial loan demands at an all-time high at their respective \\r\\ninstitutions. Two now report that this situation has moderated to a \\r\\ndegree where their banks can handle it. Our directors also report a \\r\\nhealthy pickup in deposit inflows over the last three weeks in all \\r\\ncategories, but particularly in consumer-type deposits. Mr. Kennedy \\r\\nnoted that for the first time in 1970, deposit figures at his \\r\\ninstitution are now exceeding year-ago levels. Taken together, these \\r\\nfactors represent a substantial shift toward optimism among our \\r\\nbanking directors from a month ago.], [[GNP and Real Market Aggregates], [], \\r\\n\\r\\nOur academicians shifted positions in their discussion of the \\r\\noutlook in real markets, with Eckstein becoming the most bullish. He \\r\\nsees the economy currently hovering between recession and no growth, \\r\\nbut remains convinced that most of the GNP markdown will occur in \\r\\nthe first half of this year. While he hasn't made a run on his model \\r\\nfor about three weeks now, he sees total 1970 GNP falling in the \\r\\n$982-$985 billion range, with unemployment at 5.0 to 5.2 percent by \\r\\nthe year-end. Eckstein further offered the opinion that, if we do \\r\\nhave a recession (however measured), it will be far and away the \\r\\nmildest of the postwar period.], [Wallich similarly sees 1970 nominal GNP winding up in the $980-$985 \\r\\nbillion range, with a nominal fourth-quarter gain of about $15 \\r\\nbillion. While he identified unemployment, prices, and interest \\r\\nrates as all behaving worse than expected, he expressed confidence \\r\\nthat the nominal GNP forecasts made earlier this year will hold up \\r\\nquite well. Noting how successive capital surveys have shown a \\r\\nconsistency, he does not feel that capital expenditure plans are \\r\\ncollapsing, and he sees the possibility of bringing the GNP deflator \\r\\ndown to a level of 4 percent by the year-end. On the outlook for \\r\\nunemployment in the third and fourth quarters, he was somewhat more \\r\\nbearish than Eckstein.], [Tobin once again provided the most gloomy assessment, predicting \\r\\nunemployment will rise to at least 5 1/2 percent by the year-end, \\r\\nand very possibly higher. He did not provide us with GNP projections \\r\\nfor the next two quarters.], [Again turning to the micro-oriented views of our directors, the \\r\\npicture is quite mixed. Mr. Robertson of the Bangor Punta Corp. \\r\\n(aircraft firearms, recreational equipment, farm products, etc.) \\r\\nreports that sales are continuing a sharp deterioration in nearly \\r\\nall their lines, with the one major exception the capital goods \\r\\nproduced in their process engineering division. Their layoffs have \\r\\nbeen substantial, and capital expenditure plans have been cut back \\r\\n30 to 40 percent.

District investment firms are \\r\\nencountering financial difficulties and, as a result, have had to \\r\\nalter their operations.

As a result, the directors \\r\\nfelt that guidelines would probably be publicly unpopular but in \\r\\nmany cases would be privately welcomed. In general, they thought \\r\\nthat people would prefer to see voluntary controls imposed rather \\r\\nthan new legislation, and that businessmen are more in favor of \\r\\nguidelines than labor leaders. The directors cited a number of\\r\\ninstances where business leaders have voiced approval of some kind \\r\\nof guidelines. The directors also cited cases where labor leaders \\r\\ndid not want to be quoted but were concerned with the large \\r\\nsettlements which have been won by unions in recent labor disputes. \\r\\nBecause of these large settlements, rank and file members are \\r\\nexpecting large wage increases and union leaders are afraid to ask \\r\\nfor less.

A telephone poll of two leading local investment banking \\r\\nfirms explored the implications of these problems in three areas of \\r\\ntheir operations. First, operating staffs of securities brokers have \\r\\nbeen cut back about 15 to 20 percent in the last year. These \\r\\ncutbacks, however, were attributed to the decline in volume of \\r\\ntrading rather than to the current financial crisis. In general, \\r\\nsales staffs have been reduced, with the declines occurring in some \\r\\ninstances through attrition rather than through layoffs. Second, a \\r\\nsecurities brokerage house is closing one of its suburban offices \\r\\nbecause of the lack of volume. In addition, a director was aware of \\r\\na mutual fund in Billings, Montana, which has recently closed down. \\r\\nThird, merger activity among securities brokers appears to be on the \\r\\nupswing. Both investment bankers who were contacted reported that \\r\\nthey had been approached by a number of smaller firms in the last \\r\\nthree months. Although only two mergers have been consummated, these \\r\\nfirms felt that additional mergers could take place in the not-too-distant future.], [Scattered pieces of information continue to show that District \\r\\nmanufacturers are cutting back their capital expenditure plans. Two \\r\\ndirectors cited cases where distributors of heavy equipment to \\r\\nagriculture and construction firms have experienced sharp declines \\r\\nin sales during the past month or so. It was also reported that a \\r\\nlarge retail firm headquartered in the twin cities has cut back its \\r\\ncapital appropriations by about 50 percent. One other director \\r\\nstated that General Motors has scheduled huge cutbacks in capital \\r\\nspending, with each division being asked to curtail capital \\r\\nexpenditures.], [A number of examples have come to light which suggest that consumers \\r\\nare changing their consumption patterns. A Minneapolis-based \\r\\nundergarment manufacturer reports that its sales are 10 to 15 \\r\\npercent below last year's levels. They attribute their poor sales \\r\\nperformance this year to the slowdown in department store sales and \\r\\nfeel that consumers are taking their business to lower priced \\r\\nstores.

In addition, repair shops for both automobiles and other \\r\\ndurable goods are experiencing sharp increases in business, which \\r\\nsuggest that consumers are tending to hold off on major durables \\r\\npurchases.

The \\r\\ngeneral opinion is that the economy is experiencing a mild slowdown, \\r\\nand there is no expectation of a complete recovery until the end of \\r\\nthe year. At the same time, there is little optimism that inflation \\r\\nwill be brought under control quickly. Consumer demand continues to \\r\\nbe high, although sales are somewhat slower than last year, and \\r\\nthere is continued demand upon banks for credit. The adverse effects \\r\\nof the slowdown appear in two principal forms. Unemployment is seen \\r\\nto be much higher this year, and many firms report experiencing a \\r\\nprofit squeeze. They say that they are unable to offset by price \\r\\nincreases or greater sales volume their higher costs. In \\r\\nconsequence, they are attempting to cut expenses by reducing staffs, \\r\\ncutting inventories, and delaying capital protects.], [Unemployment has risen in most parts of the District. The highest \\r\\nlevels are in the Pacific Northwest where the principal problems are \\r\\ncentered in the lumber industry and Boeing Aircraft. Boeing is the \\r\\nprincipal employer in the Seattle-Tacoma area, and it has cut its \\r\\nemployment from over 100,000 in 1968 to 58,000 now, with further \\r\\nlayoffs announced for the rest of this year to reduce the level to \\r\\n43,000. Lumber operations have been at a reduced pace throughout \\r\\nmuch of Washington and Oregon. Apparently the smaller mills are \\r\\nbearing the major burden, while the large integrated mills continue \\r\\nto maintain production. There is some expectation of a recovery, at \\r\\nleast in Oregon, toward the end of the year. The other area with a \\r\\nmajor unemployment problem is southern California, where the \\r\\naffected industries are aerospace and, to a less extent, housing.], [Construction of new residential housing and the opening of new \\r\\nsubdivisions continue to be slow. The decline in demand is heaviest \\r\\nin the Seattle area because of the layoffs at Boeing. The principal \\r\\nstrength is in commercial construction. This is certainly the case \\r\\nin California where commercial building remains high. In many cases \\r\\nthere is also a strong demand for mobile homes. This particular \\r\\nchange may be part of a tendency for consumers to downgrade the \\r\\nquality of their housing demand.\\r\\n], [Retail sales remain relatively steady despite the rising \\r\\nunemployment, and they continue to be a source of strength in most \\r\\nareas. For most kinds of consumer goods, there is no sign of \\r\\ndowngrading in choice of items as a means of economizing. Consumers \\r\\nare reported to be more careful in watching for and responding to \\r\\nsales, but there is no pronounced shift to lower grade goods. When \\r\\npurchases of major appliances are made, the demand is still for the \\r\\n\\r\\n  higher-grade line. Replies from major department stores indicate the \\r\\ngeneral composition of their business is not changed, although sales \\r\\nare not rising at last year's pace.], [There is one major exception to this picture. Reports from \\r\\nthroughout the District indicate that consumers are economizing on \\r\\ntheir automobile purchases. They are shifting away from middle-line \\r\\nmodels to lower priced and foreign economy cars, although luxury car \\r\\ndemand remains high. As part of this shift, there appears to be an \\r\\nincreased demand for late model used cars. Therefore, there is \\r\\nevidence of both a reduction of automobile purchases and a \\r\\ndowngrading of quality of purchases.], [The recent decline in the stock market has not had any noticeable \\r\\nimpact on consumer purchases, but it does seem to contribute toward \\r\\ncreating more general uncertainty on the part of businessmen. One \\r\\nspecific example of the effect of lower stock prices reported is \\r\\nthose cases where stock had been used as loan collateral and the \\r\\nborrowers were forced to sell at a loss to cover the loan.], [Many businesses report that their profit margins are being narrowed \\r\\nby higher costs, especially labor costs and by an inability to raise \\r\\ntheir revenue. Sales are not rising to offset the costs, and general \\r\\nprice increases are not always feasible. In consequence, there is \\r\\nmore emphasis upon cost reductions. This takes various forms: closer \\r\\ncontrols over inventories, increased layoffs of employees, and in \\r\\nsome cases postponement of capital projects. In fact, one of the \\r\\nclearest responses of individual businesses to this combination of \\r\\nsmaller profit margins and continued high interest rates appears in \\r\\nthe reduction of capital spending. One large oil company, for \\r\\nexample, describes its projects as being continuously reviewed, and \\r\\nseveral other manufacturing companies report a postponement and \\r\\nreduction of planned expenditures.], [Financial pressures are also an element in the slowing of business \\r\\ncapital expenditures. Several companies reported credit stringency \\r\\nand high interest costs as factors leading to a revision in their \\r\\nplans. In one case, foreign financial conditions caused difficulties \\r\\nfor one company; foreign banks were unable to supply funds normally \\r\\nutilized by this business. Financial conditions continue to be cited \\r\\nas an important adverse factor influencing the construction \\r\\nindustry. This is in spite of deliberate efforts by banks to \\r\\nallocate funds to meet this demand.

These range, however, from the \\r\\nbelief that the bottom will come in the third or fourth quarter of \\r\\nthis year, to the belief of the directors of the Cleveland Federal \\r\\nReserve Bank that the contraction will be \"more prolonged and deeper \\r\\nthan most economists and public policy makers are currently \\r\\nexpecting\".], [A growth in unemployment is noticeable throughout the country, in \\r\\nsome Districts only mildly, but in others strongly. Until recently, \\r\\nmany firms were reducing their work forces simply by letting \\r\\n\"attrition\" take its toll, but now firms are \"furloughing\" workers, \\r\\n\"cutting back\" their staffs, and \"pushing\" early retirements. In a. \\r\\nfew Districts, even \"quality\" labor has begun to be available.

A \\r\\ndefinite easing appears to have developed in the commercial banking \\r\\nsector, while our contacts in both the academic and manufacturing \\r\\nspheres now seem more convinced that the economic slowdown is \\r\\nbottoming out. In line with this general outlook, we were able to \\r\\nfind no reports of price shading at any level of business activity.], [All of our banking directors report that commercial loan demand has \\r\\ndeclined considerably since the historic highs of late spring, and \\r\\nthey characterize deposits in all categories as holding at good to \\r\\nexcellent levels. One banker director reports moderate success in \\r\\nthe large CD area following the relief given in June.

This is \\r\\napparently explained by the continuing production capacity problems \\r\\nreported by several of our respondents in manufacturing, and their \\r\\nexpectations for even heavier demands over 1971. Relative to the \\r\\nearnings picture in New England manufacturing, our contacts \\r\\nuniformly report rather poor or no success in passing along their \\r\\ncost increases. With lower internal flows and continued stringency \\r\\nin external financing arrangements, these firms are scrambling hard \\r\\nto maintain plant and equipment investment at the desired high \\r\\nlevels.], [Reports on retail activity in the region are rather more mixed, with \\r\\nsome areas reporting satisfactory volume and others reporting very \\r\\nslow sales. The impression emerges, however, that in almost all \\r\\nareas, retail sales of consumer durables have been hit hardest by \\r\\nthe slowdown.], [Professor Henry Wallich still expects a nominal GNP for the year of \\r\\n$980-983 billion, the same figure he mentioned earlier in the \\r\\nsummer. He expects declining interest rates to combine with a \\r\\nslowing of the rate of inflation to produce a substantial increase \\r\\nin the quantity of money demanded. Thus, he concludes the system \\r\\nshould reasonably pursue a 6 percent rate of money stock growth over \\r\\nthe rest of 1970. Professor Otto Eckstein concurs in this outlook \\r\\nfor GNP, now forecasting $982 billion for the year. He feels that \\r\\nrecent developments have largely offset each other in terms of \\r\\noverall economic impact. On the negative side, he attaches \\r\\nimportance to the decline in construction contracts and the sharp \\r\\ndrop in prime defense contracts. He further expects manufacturing \\r\\ninvestment to be well under current levels next year. On the plus \\r\\nside, however, are the final cessation of the truck strike, the \\r\\nturnaround in auto sales, and the largest jump in history in utility \\r\\nappropriations.], [The one major difference between Wallich and Eckstein seems to be \\r\\ntheir outlook on the future course of unemployment rates. A month \\r\\nago, Professor Wallich cautiously suggested we might reach 5-1/2 \\r\\npercent by year-end. He now is suggesting that something in the \\r\\nrange of 5-1/2 to 6 percent seems quite likely.

The Bank's most recent survey of manufacturers in \\r\\nthe district (expressed in the form of diffusion indexes) show \\r\\nrebounds in new orders and shipments during June, and a sharp \\r\\ndecline in inventories, Employment stabilized, after declining since \\r\\nlast autumn.

The \\r\\nfollowing conclusions emerged from our informal survey: (1) sales \\r\\nhave been weakening for district businesses; (2) there is widespread \\r\\nevidence that merchandise is being sold below posted list prices; \\r\\n(3) the commercial paper market is regarded as relatively stable, \\r\\nbut banks have accommodated and expect to further accommodate firms \\r\\nthat have been borrowers in the commercial paper market; (4) large \\r\\nCD rates are up at some banks, with rates at a few small banks \\r\\nexceeding 9 percent; (5) corporate liquidity is still a major \\r\\nconcern; and (6) loan demand remains strong, matching or exceeding \\r\\nseasonal expectations.], [The nonbankers noted that sales appeared to weaken somewhat in their \\r\\nindustries in recent weeks. Despite the trend in sales, most \\r\\nrespondents noted that their inventory situation had remained \\r\\nsatisfactory so that no change in inventory policy had been \\r\\nnecessary. There was an indication (confirmed by aggregate data for \\r\\nthe region) that petroleum inventories were too high at present, \\r\\neven though sales of the petroleum industry have remained strong. \\r\\nRecent reductions have been made in district petroleum production \\r\\nallowables, particularly in Texas, to curtail crude petroleum \\r\\nmining. The petroleum inventory situation may also improve because a \\r\\nshortage of tankers and reduced Libyan production has caused some \\r\\nstrengthening of domestic demand.], [The respondents were nearly unanimous in citing that , [], \\r\\n  price-cutting \\r\\nfrom posted list prices had occurred in their industries. It was \\r\\nfurther indicated that this practice has been on the increase in \\r\\nrecent weeks. Price-cutting has probably been one response to the \\r\\nweakening sales reported in several industries. One district banker \\r\\nsuggested that a form of price-cutting had been on the increase in \\r\\nthe banking industry. This was occurring through the use of gift \\r\\npremiums, reducing the size of the minimum balance required to avoid \\r\\na checking account service charge, and other innovative promotions \\r\\nto attract deposits.\\r\\n], [A series of questions were asked pertaining to recent developments \\r\\nin the commercial paper market. Nonbankers who have been active in \\r\\nthe commercial paper market, either as issuers or as buyers, \\r\\nreported no change in recent weeks in their activity or in their \\r\\npolicies toward the commercial paper market. Several bankers in the \\r\\narea, however, noted that they had recently accommodated borrowers \\r\\nwho were in the commercial paper market. Of particular note was the \\r\\nrecent accommodation by one banker of finance companies that were \\r\\nknown to utilize the commercial paper market. In addition, several \\r\\nbankers mentioned that they had outstanding lines of credit to \\r\\ncompanies that were in the commercial paper market and anticipated \\r\\nsome additional activation of these lines of credit in the near \\r\\nfuture.], [Banking respondents to our latest survey noted a generally strong \\r\\nloan demand. All reported loan demand to be either exceeding or \\r\\nmatching seasonal expectations. The source of this loan demand is \\r\\napparently from general business, but large real estate development \\r\\nprojects were particularly singled out by one banker.], [The recent change in Regulation Q rates for large denomination CD's \\r\\nwith maturities of 30 to 89 days has brought mixed responses from \\r\\ndistrict bankers. About half of our survey respondents reported that \\r\\nthey had increased their offering rates (usually to the 7 1/2 - 8 \\r\\npercent range, but exceeding 9 percent at a few small banks) while \\r\\nhalf reported they had not changed their rates. Of the bankers who \\r\\nhad increased rates on CD's, only one reported any reduced reliance \\r\\non sources of borrowed funds, such as Eurodollars, commercial paper, \\r\\nor federal funds. To the extent that additional funds are being \\r\\nattracted to district banks by the higher CD rates, it appears these \\r\\nfunds are being utilized to make new loan or investment commitments \\r\\nand not to reduce reliance on borrowed sources of funds.

Meanwhile, repair shops for automobiles and \\r\\nother durable goods are reporting record volumes of business; a \\r\\nregional parts distribution center for a major automobile \\r\\nmanufacturer in the twin cities reports that the demand for \\r\\nautomobile parts is so great that its crews are working overtime. \\r\\nAlthough automobile sales in the district are still at depressed \\r\\nlevels, the weakness seems to be centered on the more expensive \\r\\nmodels while the market for lighter, economy models and used autos \\r\\nappears to be relatively strong.], [The greatest evidence of \"price shading\" in the district is at the \\r\\nretail level. In addition to markdowns on automobiles, the directors \\r\\nfelt that retailers were holding sales earlier than usual this \\r\\nsummer and were offering larger discounts. One reason given for this \\r\\nwas that inventories appear to be larger than desired because of the \\r\\ngeneral slowing in retail sales. Retailers are also concerned that \\r\\nthey will \"get stuck\" with merchandise that was ordered before the \\r\\ntruckers' strike and is only now arriving.], [There appears to be very little \"price shading\" for industrial \\r\\ngoods, and directors and officers of the bank cited a number of \\r\\ncases where prices have actually risen in the past few weeks. In \\r\\ngeneral the feeling was that manufacturers do not have adequate \\r\\nmargins with which to cut prices. As one director put it, \"business \\r\\nis hurting but volume at a loss doesn't help.\" Another felt that \\r\\nindustrial suppliers are beginning to drop unprofitable lines. On \\r\\nthe other hand one director indicated that discounts in some \\r\\nconstruction materials are greater now than they were a year ago. He \\r\\nwas careful to point out, however, that list prices have risen \\r\\nduring the past year, and as a result, the net effect on prices is \\r\\nnot clear. He noted that sales efforts among construction materials \\r\\ndistributors have intensified, and that they have improved services \\r\\nincluding schedules in order to increase their sales.], [The slowing in sales along with a decreased availability of funds \\r\\nhas led to an increase in district business failures. The three most \\r\\ncommon characteristics of failing businesses are that they were \\r\\nrelatively young firms, were in industries in which entry is fairly \\r\\neasy, and/or were undercapitalized. Of the 21 failures of which one \\r\\nleading district banker was aware, all could be attributed to one or \\r\\nmore of these factors. One director observed that the number of \\r\\nfailures or near failures in the construction industry has risen in \\r\\nrecent months. The primary cause for this is the lack of working \\r\\ncapital, a problem which is chronic in the industry, but which has \\r\\nbecome increasingly acute because of the large number of recent \\r\\nstrikes and the slowing in construction activity.], [\\r\\n                            We serve the public by pursuing a growing economy and stable financial system that work for all of us., [\\n]]]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

While it was thought the current strains in the \\r\\nfinancial markets did not pose a serious immediate threat to \\r\\nbusiness activity, considerable concern was expressed regarding \\r\\nbusiness liquidity.], [Only two of the Federal Reserve Bank Directors who attended the \\r\\nearly July meetings at New York and Buffalo were aware of any price \\r\\nshading by manufacturers, but more directors mentioned other signs \\r\\nof an improvement in the overall price situation. These included \\r\\nannounced price cuts, particularly at the retail level, as well as \\r\\nprice shading at the retail level by giving the customer greater \\r\\nvalue. With regard to, [],  \\r\\nunder-the-counter price adjustments, it was \\r\\nreported that Bethlehem Steel Corporation had taken a strong \\r\\nposition against such a marketing practice. As for announced cuts by \\r\\nmanufacturers, one director noted receiving an announcement of a \\r\\nthree percent reduction in the price of cans for packaging \\r\\nbeverages. At the retail level, there has been considerable price \\r\\ncutting by automobile dealers as well as by other retail outlets, \\r\\nwith the aim of either reducing inventories or building sales \\r\\nvolume.], [Retail store sales reportedly were holding up well, except at downtown stores and during night shopping hours. Sales apparently were \\r\\nbeing bolstered by aggressive merchandising. The head of a large \\r\\nchain observed, however, that retail stores need an increase of \\r\\nthree to three and one half percent in volume to bring profit up to \\r\\nlast year's level. Contributing to this need were higher costs \\r\\nstemming from increases in wage rates, in shipping charges, and in \\r\\nshoplifting.\\r\\n], [The directors were virtually unanimous in believing that the more \\r\\ncautious capital spending pattern that apparently has developed in \\r\\nrecent months will continue into 1971. New programs were being \"very \\r\\ncarefully reviewed,\" and many projects were being slowed down or \\r\\nindefinitely deferred. However, projects for which commitments are \\r\\ntoo far along to be canceled or postponed are being completed, as \\r\\nprobably will be projects designed to cut production costs and \\r\\nincrease productivity. Although an upstate New York banker remarked \\r\\nthat there were no signs of cutback in his area, he observed that \\r\\nmost of the capital spending there was on construction for \\r\\nmunicipalities and school districts, for which firm contracts had \\r\\nbeen arranged \"long ago.\" On the other hand, a community college \\r\\nconstruction project for which bids were recently obtained may have \\r\\nto be canceled because the bids are so far above the original \\r\\nestimates.], [\\r\\nThe few comments made on the inventory situation suggested that \\r\\ninventories were higher than were desired. A New York banker \\r\\ncommented that inventories in general are eight to ten percent above \\r\\na year ago, and that increased inventories were particularly evident \\r\\nin the soft goods area. The chairman of a large manufacturing firm \\r\\nobserved that inventories were high mainly because business \"is not \\r\\nselling goods as fast as desired,\" although special factors such as \\r\\nthe recent truckers' strike in Chicago had contributed to the \\r\\nbuildup, as had \"a new permanent inflation factor\" that has been \\r\\nbuilt into inventories.], [Most directors seemed to believe the current strains in the \\r\\nfinancial markets did not pose a serious threat to business activity \\r\\nat the present time, although the head of a large New York City bank \\r\\ndeclared he thought there would be \"adverse\" effects, but was unable \\r\\nto judge whether these would be \"serious.\" Despite the near-consensus that there was no immediate threat, a number of directors \\r\\nand other business executives did indicate concern regarding \\r\\nfinancial developments. A banker from upstate New York noted that \\r\\nmany businessmen who have long-term financings in the offing are \\r\\nattempting to arrange standby intermediate or short-term credits as \\r\\npossible alternative solutions to their financing needs. An \\r\\ninvestment banker commented that his firm had been marketing four-to-five year securities for many clients, and that if inflation is \\r\\nnot halted, he sees \"an end to public financing of debt issues.\" A \\r\\nlarge retailer observed that small manufacturers were in serious \\r\\nshape with regard to liquidity; they cannot borrow as easily as very \\r\\nbig concerns, and at the same time big retailers are slower in \\r\\nmaking payments to them than in the past, inasmuch as the discount \\r\\nfor prompt payment is less than the cost of borrowing money. \\r\\nCustomer payments to retail stores were also noted as slower than \\r\\nusual, The head of a New York academic institution declared the long \\r\\ndecline in the stock market had cut gifts to private educational \\r\\ninstitutions and had drastically reduced the market value of \\r\\nholdings of endowed institutions.

The chairman of a large mutual savings bank \\r\\nremarked, late in June, that although official figures indicate a \\r\\nrecent pick-up in deposits at thrift institutions, there is no \\r\\nevidence of such a movement in New York City. He thought that most \\r\\nof the deposit money that was being withdrawn was probably going \\r\\ninto bonds.

Most of them see a slowdown in the pace of economic \\r\\nactivity with no sign of any quick upswing, but few report any \\r\\nfeeling that the slowdown will worsen. Both prices and costs are \\r\\nexpected to show further increases, and price shading is not \\r\\nwidespread. The area with the most severe problems in terms of \\r\\nunemployment continues to be the Pacific Northwest, where both the \\r\\naircraft and lumber industries continue to reduce employment. \\r\\nDirectors who are associated with the lumber industry report that \\r\\ncompanies are curtailing production, with many firms on a four-day \\r\\nweek and usually with only one shift. In Oregon, it is reported, the \\r\\nmajority of the small mills have been shut down for over two months \\r\\nand many may never reopen. Even some large firms dependent upon \\r\\npublic timber are having difficulties, and one director forecast \\r\\nthat some large firms would be out of business by spring.], [Another area with above-average unemployment is Southern California. \\r\\nThe aircraft and defense industries are suffering the most, but \\r\\ntheir relative impact on that area's economy is smaller than in the \\r\\nNorthwest, and total economic activity in Southern California \\r\\nremains strong. A large electronics manufacturer in the San \\r\\nFrancisco area has reduced its workweek in response to a fall in \\r\\norders. It chose this method of reducing output rather than having \\r\\nlayoffs and risking losing skilled employees. Declines in \\r\\nmanufacturing, mainly machinery and electrical goods, are also \\r\\nreported for Arizona, where total employment declined for the first \\r\\ntime since January. Unemployment is higher in Alaska, in part \\r\\nbecause of a slowdown in the oil field development.], [Prices continue to rise, with the notable exception of lumber and \\r\\nplywood prices. Consumer demand remains steady, although where \\r\\nunemployment is high the sustaining effect of unemployment payments \\r\\nmay disappear as benefits are used up. Therefore retail sales may \\r\\nfall more in such areas. Another unfavorable aspect noted by one \\r\\ndirector is the increase in the number of personal bankruptcies.], [Businesses continue to face a squeeze on their profitsâ€”especially \\r\\nthose now experiencing substantial wage demands. Retailers are \\r\\ndescribed in some cases as reluctant to maintain margins by \\r\\nincreasing prices. There is continued emphasis on cutting costs. As \\r\\npart of this trend, bankers report reduced demand for loans to \\r\\nsupport inventories. In some industries, prospective labor problems \\r\\nadd to uncertainty.], [\\r\\nThe oil industry has some difficulties in controlling discounting of \\r\\ngasoline on the retail level, despite withdrawal of temporary dealer \\r\\nallowances. In addition, it has some supply problems caused by the \\r\\nloss of Arabian crude oil supplies due to the shutdown of the Trans-Arabian pipeline and cutbacks in Libyan oil production. There are \\r\\nalso uncertainties about the future need for the production of \\r\\nunleaded gasoline.], [\\r\\nIn agriculture the picture is mixed. Cattle prices continue to hold, \\r\\nbut there is weakness in some areas dependent upon fruits and \\r\\nvegetables, such as Washington and Southern California. The decline \\r\\nin citrus production is not expected to be compensated by higher \\r\\nprices. In Washington, packers are operating at below capacity.

Steel production for the \\r\\nthird quarter, largely reflecting demand from auto companies, is expected to be \\r\\nslightly above the second quarter after allowance for the normal summer \\r\\nslowdown. Several local labor-management disputes in the Cleveland area have \\r\\nbeen settled at high cost. District bankers report they expect loan demand to \\r\\nremain strong and money market conditions to stay comfortable in the immediate \\r\\nfuture. Several of our Branch Directors expect the economy to remain sluggish in \\r\\nthe foreseeable future.], [Economic activity in the District improved significantly in June after the \\r\\ntermination of major strikes, and preliminary and limited data suggest that \\r\\nactivity remained at about the same level in July. The District's insured \\r\\nunemployment rate was essentially unchanged in July, and steel production rose \\r\\nmoderately. Economists in the steel industry report that auto companies have \\r\\nplaced orders at normal levels for steel deliveries for July, August, and \\r\\nSeptember, despite auto strike possibilities. Auto firms regularly place a \\r\\nnormal level of steel orders before contract negotiations, and this year will \\r\\nask steel firms to take finished steel into inventories if a strike materializes \\r\\nin mid-September. Furthermore, if a strike occurs, production should not decline \\r\\nas much as shipments because inventory building will probably occur at the mills \\r\\nlate in the year. Trade sources report that auto companies are unable to get \\r\\ncommitments for Japanese steel to be delivered next year. Apparently, Japan will \\r\\nnot accept steel orders above the voluntary quotas, and will not divert steel to \\r\\nautomotive companies from regular customers. Steel industry economists in our \\r\\narea report export demand is declining rapidly.], [Striking sheetmetal workers and plumbers in Cleveland settled their disputes at \\r\\nthe end of July and in early August. Only one major unionâ€”pipefittersâ€”remains on \\r\\nstrike, but this is enough to keep construction at a reduced level in the \\r\\nCleveland area. The principal unresolved issue is the hiring of minority \\r\\nworkers. A $3 per hour increase over three years (raising journeyman rates by \\r\\n1972 to $9.41 for painters, $10.20 for iron workers, and $10.81 for sheetmetal \\r\\nworkers, for example) appears to be the pattern of settlement accepted by all of \\r\\nthe other construction crafts in the area. The increases will further widen the \\r\\nlocal-national differential in average hourly earnings for journeymen and \\r\\nhelpers in all construction trades (last year, $5.99 in Cleveland and $4.78 in \\r\\nthe nation).], [Economists and senior investment officers at several of the largest banks in the \\r\\nDistrict were recently surveyed informally regarding their current views and \\r\\nexpectations about the economy, the banking situation, and money market \\r\\nconditions. Almost all of the respondents indicated they expect the economy to \\r\\nremain sluggish during the second half of 1970, although most of the economists \\r\\nlook for a modest increase in real activity. All of the major banks in the \\r\\nDistrict are experiencing strong loan demand and demand is expected to remain \\r\\nbrisk over the foreseeable future. Respondents felt that the present comfortable \\r\\ntone of the money market would continue and that funds would be readily \\r\\navailable to banks at interest rates equal to or slightly below current levels. \\r\\nOne investment officer from a large bank reported that they had just reduced the \\r\\nrate on 60-89 day money to 7 3/4 per cent and would now pay a uniform rate \\r\\nacross the board in the , [], \\r\\n30-89 day maturity range. The same bank anticipates \\r\\nanother reduction in the CD rate in the near future. All of the banks are much \\r\\nmore concerned about the credit worthiness of borrowers than formerly, and \\r\\nexpressed the view that this concern would persist.], [Several of our Cincinnati Branch Directors, at a meeting of the Board last \\r\\nMonday, commented about the continued sluggishness of the economy.

They indicated that business sales are slightly ahead of a \\r\\nyear ago, and inventories of most firms are \"about right.\" Some excess capacity \\r\\nis reported. Capital spending apparently peaked in 1969 and is currently \\r\\ndeclining. Capital spending is expected to increase somewhat in 1971 but to \\r\\nremain below the current-dollar level of 1969. Employment cutbacks are reported \\r\\nby more than half of the responding firms, but wages and salaries are up \\r\\nconsiderably. Hurricane Celia hit the West Gulf Coast of Texas and caused damage \\r\\nestimated in excess of $500 million.], [Most of the corporate executives reported that sales were a little higher so far \\r\\nin 1970 than in the same period a year ago. One electronic firm indicated that \\r\\nsales this year had lagged behind the level of a year ago, and another noted \\r\\nsome softness in their recent orders. One firm in the computer industry reported \\r\\nthat sales so far this year were up from a year ago but weakness is expected in \\r\\nthe months ahead. One firm particularly noted an increase in price consciousness \\r\\namong their customers.], [Although sales have not been particularly strong, most of the firms indicate \\r\\nthat they are about in line with expectations. This would suggest that the \\r\\nbusiness slowdown was correctly anticipated by most. Because the correct sales \\r\\ntrend was anticipated by most firms, current inventory levels are considered \\r\\n\"about right\" by the majority. Three firms did indicate that their inventories \\r\\nwere somewhat too high at the present time.], [More than half of the firms represented in our sample project capital spending \\r\\nfor the year 1970 to be less than in 1969. The dollar value of capital spending \\r\\nby these firms will likely be down about 14 per cent in 1970 from the 1969 \\r\\nlevel. Much of the weakness in capital spending apparently stems from a trimming \\r\\nback of earlier plans. Half of the respondents indicated that the dollar value \\r\\nof their capital appropriations for the second half of 1970 was less than \\r\\nearlier preliminary plans. Not a single firm reported that capital \\r\\nappropriations for the second half of this year would be larger than their \\r\\npreliminary plans. These declining capital spending plans are consistent with \\r\\nthe report of \"a little\" excess capacity at four firms while one reported much \\r\\nexcess capacity. There were no reports of capacity shortage. Some of the decline \\r\\nin capital spending from the high 1969 level is accounted for by electronic and \\r\\ncomputer firms that have been affected by the trimming of the defense budget, as \\r\\nwell as by the overall business slowdown. Another major factor in the capital \\r\\nspending decline is the tapering off of construction by a large national gas \\r\\npipeline company. The lack of new gas supplies has reduced their need to expand \\r\\nthe transmission system. The only real strength in 1970 capital spending comes \\r\\nfrom one electric utility and some oil drilling and refining firms.], [Capital spending for 1971 for this group of firms is now planned to be up \\r\\nslightly from the expected 1970 level but still about 7 per cent below the \\r\\nrealized 1969 level in current dollars. Two-thirds of the firms actually expect \\r\\ncapital outlays to be less in 1971 than in 1970. A substantial increase in \\r\\ncapital spending is projected by a large oil company.], [Every firm responding to this questionnaire reports that employee wages and \\r\\nsalaries are up this year. The most common increase was 6 to 7 per cent while \\r\\nthe range was from 3.5 to 8 per cent. More than half of the firms have cut back \\r\\ntheir employment level this year with the cutbacks ranging from as low as 1 per \\r\\ncent to as high as 25 per cent.

Damage estimates range from $500 million to $1 billion. Banking services were \\r\\nhalted for two days and then reopened on a limited basis. About 3 per cent of \\r\\nthe U.

District manufacturers \\r\\nresponding to our latest industrial expectations survey feel that \\r\\nthe rate of advance in District manufacturing sales will continue \\r\\nsluggish during the remainder of 1970.], [In responding to a question on corporate profits, bank directors and \\r\\nofficers indicated that profits in the Ninth District suffered or at \\r\\nbest held steady during the second quarter, although there were \\r\\nnotable exceptions. In response to this situation numerous examples \\r\\nof cost cutting were cited. An economist for a large national \\r\\nmanufacturer stated that attitudes have changed in his company on \\r\\nwhat constitutes a necessary cost. One large brewery in the Twin \\r\\nCities cut its current advertising budget by $800,000. District \\r\\nemployers have curtailed their utilization of labor through layoffs \\r\\nand overtime reductions, and a large Minneapolis computer \\r\\nmanufacturer instructed each employee to take ten days of unpaid \\r\\nvacation before the end of the year. Cost cutting is also \\r\\nmanifesting itself in reductions in capital spending and inventory \\r\\ncutbacks.], [\\r\\nAlthough reports indicate District businessmen are trying to cut \\r\\ninventories, several cases of unwanted inventory accumulation were \\r\\nreported. One large Twin City manufacturer's inventory increased \\r\\nbecause of overly optimistic sales projections. Reports reveal that \\r\\nthe large retailers and a national mail order house have accumulated \\r\\ninventories because of the trucking strike. They are receiving this \\r\\nsummer' s seasonal merchandise late and are being forced to cut its \\r\\nprice to avoid carrying it over.], [One factor, however, that will impede cost cutting efforts by \\r\\nDistrict businessmen is the recent large wage concessions granted to \\r\\nthe construction workers and Teamsters. As a result of these \\r\\nsettlements, bank directors indicate that unions in their areas are \\r\\nbecoming very aggressive in their wage demands, making the \\r\\nsettlement of some current negotiations difficult. One director \\r\\nreports that construction companies are cutting overtime because of \\r\\nthe large wage settlements.], [\\r\\n                            We serve the public by pursuing a growing economy and stable financial system that work for all of us., [\\n]]]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

A mixture of reports is common, however, within most manufacturing industries important to this District, and the slight improvement is due to fewer reports of further declines rather than to any significant resurgence of orders.], [Recent improvement in retail sales, especially in automobiles, is reported. Reports from West Virginia, however, indicate that business has been seriously affected by the current coal miners' strike. Manufacturers' inventories, while apparently being reduced somewhat, are still reported to be higher than desired.], [\\r\\nThe District employment situation apparently remains weak. While some further employment declines are reported in textiles, chemicals, metals, and electrical equipment, the declines do not appear as widespread as they were two or three months ago. The length of the work week, however, is reportedly still decreasing in manufacturing industries.], [\\r\\nReports of increasing unemployment are common throughout the Fifth District, and available labor supplies are generally regarded as adequate. Respondents in manufacturing as well as trade and services report skilled labor to be in relatively short supply, but they feel that there are adequate numbers of unskilled workers available.], [\\r\\nReports indicate that, on balance, prices continue to rise in the District. Coal, fabricated metal items, and electrical machinery are among the District's manufacturing industries in which prices are reported increasing. Large increases in coal prices are of considerable concern in the region because of implications they have for electric utility rates as well as other services. Few instances of actual declines in list prices are reported, although respondents continue to report evidence of price shading. Continued upward pressure on wages is reported in nonferrous metals and furniture manufacturing.], [Residential construction, which has been severely depressed in the District, is reported somewhat improved in recent weeks. Though still on the down side, some improvement is reported in residential building activity in certain areas of North Carolina, Virginia, and West Virginia, and in the Baltimore area. Nonresidential building, which has fared better in recent months, apparently is continuing to improve throughout the District generally.], [Loan demand of all types at banks in the District apparently has failed to keep pace with last month's reported rise. Demand for business loans is reported essentially unchanged, and consumer loan demand has increased only slightly. Increases in mortgage loan demand were reported to be significant in May and June, but began to taper last month, and were only marginal in the most recent four-week period.], [\\r\\nThe number of respondents reporting that they expect further decline in general economic activity diminished substantially in the most recent survey. Evidence of optimism, however, remains spotty, and apparently no general expectation of an immediate recovery exists yet in the Fifth District.], [Respondents in the District have been far from unanimous in their evaluations of their capital spending plans. While some respondents have indicated reductions, planned capital spending apparently has not been substantially reduced in recent months. The latest survey, however, indicates somewhat more widespread reductions than before, especially in textiles, chemicals, and furniture manufacturing.], [Inventories in manufacturing and in trade and services remain on the high side.

Some economists, however, reported \"under the table\" \\r\\ndiscounting and price rebates, which presumably are not being \\r\\nrecorded in the official price indexes.

Economists from two major auto companies believed the worst of \\r\\nthe cutback in new car sales and production was over and that, \\r\\nfollowing leveling tendencies in the second and third quarters, \\r\\nsales would recover later in the year.

However, customer \\r\\nresistance to higher priced brands has increased, with lower priced \\r\\nmerchandise receiving the benefit. A canvass of merchants by one of \\r\\nour Branch offices indicated that they expect no improvement in \\r\\nsales within the near future. Regarding auto sales, distributors \\r\\ncontacted report some shifting from larger cars to the compact \\r\\nsized, loaded with optional equipment. Rather than settling for a \\r\\nstripped-down version of a full-sized car, customers are purchasing \\r\\nlower priced equipment-packed models.], [[Belt tightening], [], \\r\\n A profit squeeze is causing many businesses to trim \\r\\nfat wherever possible. Reports of capital expenditures being reduced \\r\\nor stretched out have been coming from several sources.

A large \\r\\nsteel producer in Alabama and a large aluminum company in Tennessee \\r\\nare reportedly cutting employment by as much as 20 percent. A \\r\\nMississippi furniture manufacturer is reported to be trimming \\r\\nemployment from 2,800 to 1,700. A 500-man cutback is imminent at \\r\\nanother firm, and a District bank is cutting employmentâ€”this one by \\r\\n10 percent across the board. A regional airline is cutting its work \\r\\nforce by 100, \"purely as an economy move\".

Their \\r\\ncomments, as given below, are separated on the basis of real versus \\r\\nmonetary markets.], [[Monetary Conditions and Capital Markets], [], \\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Otto Eckstein characterized capital markets as currently \\r\\nbeing in a \"most unusual state\", attributing this to (1) the \\r\\nSystem's switch to aggregate targets, (2) the continuing high rate \\r\\nof inflation and suspicion that it will not abate, and (3) \\r\\nuncertainties wrought by Cambodia andâ€”particularlyâ€”the stock \\r\\nmarket. With respect to the Fed's current stance, Eckstein \\r\\nemphatically pointed out that policy can be judged as having been \\r\\neasier over the last few months only by a monetarist's standards. \\r\\nMeasured from any starting month previous to February 1970, the \\r\\nwidely touted 10 percent annual growth rate of money stock shrinks \\r\\nto 3 to 5 percent. On top of this moderate rate of growth, Eckstein \\r\\ninterprets the events of April and May as having led to a greatly \\r\\nincreased liquidity preference on the part of the public, concluding \\r\\nthat endorsement of a 4 percent rate of monetary growth during the \\r\\ncurrent period is \"really somewhat cavalier\".], [Professor James Tobin concurred with Eckstein on this view of System \\r\\npolicy, additionally pointing out that with a 4 or 5 percent rate of \\r\\ngrowth, money supply is shrinking in real terms. Tobin also voiced \\r\\nfears that the Fed's excessively tight policy in combination with \\r\\nits shift to aggregate targets has forced interest rates to a point \\r\\nwell above the real rate of return on capital, a state of affairs he \\r\\nfeels will depress real activity more than we are bargaining for.], [At the opposite end of the spectrum was Professor Henry Wallich, who \\r\\nstated that Fed policy is threatening to become overly easy \"no \\r\\nmatter how money stock is measured\".], [\\r\\nViews varied also on the causes and the implications of the stock \\r\\nmarket decline. Wallich feels the principal explanation is the \\r\\nnecessary, but painful, adjustment of equity markets to a 9 percent \\r\\nbond market. Tobin, on the other hand, feels the decline has been \\r\\nserious, stating that it will have both wealth and cost of capital \\r\\neffects, and that it is symptomatic of a general economic malaise. \\r\\nWhen viewed from the more regional, micro outlook of our banking \\r\\ndirectors, money market conditions appeared more optimistic. Only a \\r\\nmonth ago all three of our Class A directors were reporting \\r\\ncommercial loan demands at an all-time high at their respective \\r\\ninstitutions. Two now report that this situation has moderated to a \\r\\ndegree where their banks can handle it. Our directors also report a \\r\\nhealthy pickup in deposit inflows over the last three weeks in all \\r\\ncategories, but particularly in consumer-type deposits. Mr. Kennedy \\r\\nnoted that for the first time in 1970, deposit figures at his \\r\\ninstitution are now exceeding year-ago levels. Taken together, these \\r\\nfactors represent a substantial shift toward optimism among our \\r\\nbanking directors from a month ago.], [[GNP and Real Market Aggregates], [], \\r\\n\\r\\nOur academicians shifted positions in their discussion of the \\r\\noutlook in real markets, with Eckstein becoming the most bullish. He \\r\\nsees the economy currently hovering between recession and no growth, \\r\\nbut remains convinced that most of the GNP markdown will occur in \\r\\nthe first half of this year. While he hasn't made a run on his model \\r\\nfor about three weeks now, he sees total 1970 GNP falling in the \\r\\n$982-$985 billion range, with unemployment at 5.0 to 5.2 percent by \\r\\nthe year-end. Eckstein further offered the opinion that, if we do \\r\\nhave a recession (however measured), it will be far and away the \\r\\nmildest of the postwar period.], [Wallich similarly sees 1970 nominal GNP winding up in the $980-$985 \\r\\nbillion range, with a nominal fourth-quarter gain of about $15 \\r\\nbillion. While he identified unemployment, prices, and interest \\r\\nrates as all behaving worse than expected, he expressed confidence \\r\\nthat the nominal GNP forecasts made earlier this year will hold up \\r\\nquite well. Noting how successive capital surveys have shown a \\r\\nconsistency, he does not feel that capital expenditure plans are \\r\\ncollapsing, and he sees the possibility of bringing the GNP deflator \\r\\ndown to a level of 4 percent by the year-end. On the outlook for \\r\\nunemployment in the third and fourth quarters, he was somewhat more \\r\\nbearish than Eckstein.], [Tobin once again provided the most gloomy assessment, predicting \\r\\nunemployment will rise to at least 5 1/2 percent by the year-end, \\r\\nand very possibly higher. He did not provide us with GNP projections \\r\\nfor the next two quarters.], [Again turning to the micro-oriented views of our directors, the \\r\\npicture is quite mixed. Mr. Robertson of the Bangor Punta Corp. \\r\\n(aircraft firearms, recreational equipment, farm products, etc.) \\r\\nreports that sales are continuing a sharp deterioration in nearly \\r\\nall their lines, with the one major exception the capital goods \\r\\nproduced in their process engineering division. Their layoffs have \\r\\nbeen substantial, and capital expenditure plans have been cut back \\r\\n30 to 40 percent. Other directors, however, noted that layoffs seem \\r\\nto have subsided in their areas. Messrs. Cabot (Cabot Corp.) and \\r\\nCarter (Nashua Corp.) report their capital expenditure plans are \\r\\ncontinuing at or near the levels originally planned, althoughâ€”apropos of Tobin's point aboveâ€”Mr. Carter did note that their \\r\\ncapital spending is becoming increasingly contingent upon securing \\r\\nreasonably priced financing. Other queries to our directors produced \\r\\nno shift in sentiment from the views they expressed a month ago.], [\\r\\n                            We serve the public by pursuing a growing economy and stable financial system that work for all of us., [\\n]]]</td>\n",

One Board member in June and \\r\\none in May did report a substantial downward revision in plans for \\r\\nthe current year. These capital spending plans are consistent with \\r\\nthe view of most Board members that sales in their industry are \\r\\neither stabilizing or strengthening at the present time. \\r\\nFurthermore, nearly all the Board members report that corporate \\r\\nplanning in their firms for 1971 is based on the expectation of a \\r\\nmodest increase in sales and profits.

Sales of department stores in the District were very \\r\\nsluggish during the last two thirds of May, and in some weeks the \\r\\ncurrent-dollar sales actually trailed the figure for the \\r\\ncorresponding weeks a year ago.

The \\r\\ngeneral opinion is that the economy is experiencing a mild slowdown, \\r\\nand there is no expectation of a complete recovery until the end of \\r\\nthe year. At the same time, there is little optimism that inflation \\r\\nwill be brought under control quickly. Consumer demand continues to \\r\\nbe high, although sales are somewhat slower than last year, and \\r\\nthere is continued demand upon banks for credit. The adverse effects \\r\\nof the slowdown appear in two principal forms. Unemployment is seen \\r\\nto be much higher this year, and many firms report experiencing a \\r\\nprofit squeeze. They say that they are unable to offset by price \\r\\nincreases or greater sales volume their higher costs. In \\r\\nconsequence, they are attempting to cut expenses by reducing staffs, \\r\\ncutting inventories, and delaying capital protects.], [Unemployment has risen in most parts of the District. The highest \\r\\nlevels are in the Pacific Northwest where the principal problems are \\r\\ncentered in the lumber industry and Boeing Aircraft. Boeing is the \\r\\nprincipal employer in the Seattle-Tacoma area, and it has cut its \\r\\nemployment from over 100,000 in 1968 to 58,000 now, with further \\r\\nlayoffs announced for the rest of this year to reduce the level to \\r\\n43,000. Lumber operations have been at a reduced pace throughout \\r\\nmuch of Washington and Oregon. Apparently the smaller mills are \\r\\nbearing the major burden, while the large integrated mills continue \\r\\nto maintain production. There is some expectation of a recovery, at \\r\\nleast in Oregon, toward the end of the year. The other area with a \\r\\nmajor unemployment problem is southern California, where the \\r\\naffected industries are aerospace and, to a less extent, housing.], [Construction of new residential housing and the opening of new \\r\\nsubdivisions continue to be slow. The decline in demand is heaviest \\r\\nin the Seattle area because of the layoffs at Boeing. The principal \\r\\nstrength is in commercial construction. This is certainly the case \\r\\nin California where commercial building remains high. In many cases \\r\\nthere is also a strong demand for mobile homes. This particular \\r\\nchange may be part of a tendency for consumers to downgrade the \\r\\nquality of their housing demand.\\r\\n], [Retail sales remain relatively steady despite the rising \\r\\nunemployment, and they continue to be a source of strength in most \\r\\nareas. For most kinds of consumer goods, there is no sign of \\r\\ndowngrading in choice of items as a means of economizing. Consumers \\r\\nare reported to be more careful in watching for and responding to \\r\\nsales, but there is no pronounced shift to lower grade goods. When \\r\\npurchases of major appliances are made, the demand is still for the \\r\\n\\r\\n  higher-grade line. Replies from major department stores indicate the \\r\\ngeneral composition of their business is not changed, although sales \\r\\nare not rising at last year's pace.], [There is one major exception to this picture. Reports from \\r\\nthroughout the District indicate that consumers are economizing on \\r\\ntheir automobile purchases. They are shifting away from middle-line \\r\\nmodels to lower priced and foreign economy cars, although luxury car \\r\\ndemand remains high. As part of this shift, there appears to be an \\r\\nincreased demand for late model used cars. Therefore, there is \\r\\nevidence of both a reduction of automobile purchases and a \\r\\ndowngrading of quality of purchases.], [The recent decline in the stock market has not had any noticeable \\r\\nimpact on consumer purchases, but it does seem to contribute toward \\r\\ncreating more general uncertainty on the part of businessmen. One \\r\\nspecific example of the effect of lower stock prices reported is \\r\\nthose cases where stock had been used as loan collateral and the \\r\\nborrowers were forced to sell at a loss to cover the loan.], [Many businesses report that their profit margins are being narrowed \\r\\nby higher costs, especially labor costs and by an inability to raise \\r\\ntheir revenue. Sales are not rising to offset the costs, and general \\r\\nprice increases are not always feasible. In consequence, there is \\r\\nmore emphasis upon cost reductions. This takes various forms: closer \\r\\ncontrols over inventories, increased layoffs of employees, and in \\r\\nsome cases postponement of capital projects. In fact, one of the \\r\\nclearest responses of individual businesses to this combination of \\r\\nsmaller profit margins and continued high interest rates appears in \\r\\nthe reduction of capital spending. One large oil company, for \\r\\nexample, describes its projects as being continuously reviewed, and \\r\\nseveral other manufacturing companies report a postponement and \\r\\nreduction of planned expenditures.], [Financial pressures are also an element in the slowing of business \\r\\ncapital expenditures. Several companies reported credit stringency \\r\\nand high interest costs as factors leading to a revision in their \\r\\nplans. In one case, foreign financial conditions caused difficulties \\r\\nfor one company; foreign banks were unable to supply funds normally \\r\\nutilized by this business. Financial conditions continue to be cited \\r\\nas an important adverse factor influencing the construction \\r\\nindustry. This is in spite of deliberate efforts by banks to \\r\\nallocate funds to meet this demand. Banks are continuing to be \\r\\nselected in the kinds of loans that they make.], [In summary, reports of our directors and other businessmen point to \\r\\na slowing of the pace of economic activity and a greater reluctance \\r\\non their part to undertake major expenditures in the near future.], [\\r\\n                            We serve the public by pursuing a growing economy and stable financial system that work for all of us., [\\n]]]</td>\n",

Until recently, \\r\\nmany firms were reducing their work forces simply by letting \\r\\n\"attrition\" take its toll, but now firms are \"furloughing\" workers, \\r\\n\"cutting back\" their staffs, and \"pushing\" early retirements. In a. \\r\\nfew Districts, even \"quality\" labor has begun to be available.

Department \\r\\nstores seemed to be particularly hard hit by the softening of \\r\\ndemand, while discount stores and \"bargain basements\" were holding \\r\\nup well. Weakness was particularly strong in furniture, appliances, \\r\\ntelevision sets, and clothing. Auto buying was an area where \\r\\n\"downgrading\" was especially intenseâ€”except in Dallas. The trend \\r\\nwas heavily to cheaper models, stripped-down models, \"compacts\", \\r\\nlow-priced imports, and late-model used cars. Outside the auto \\r\\nfield, in the few Districts where no \"downgrading\" was apparent, \\r\\nconsumers nevertheless had a sharp eye out for \"sales\" and \\r\\n\"specials\". In the San Francisco District, a \"strong\" demand for \\r\\nmobile homes was interpreted as possibly a form of \"downgrading\".], [In two Districts, Richmond and St. Louis, capital spending plans \\r\\ncontinue strong, out of \"fear\" of inflation or to offset increased \\r\\nlabor costs. However, in the five other Districts that made \\r\\nreference to the subject, many firms are making substantial \\r\\ncutbacks.

They were regarded as \"excessive\" in two of the \\r\\nDistricts, and were being \"reduced\" in a third. In two others they \\r\\nwere at a \"satisfactory\" level, partly because firms were working on \\r\\na \"hand-to-mouth\" basis. In another District, reference was to \\r\\nmerchandising firms, which were being \"extremely cautious\" regarding \\r\\ntheir fall and winter stocks.], [The profit squeeze is hitting many businesses very hard in many \\r\\nparts of the country. The situation is aggravated by a liquidity \\r\\nsqueeze. Slow payment on accounts receivable was mentioned by both \\r\\nChicago and New York as one of the reasons for this latter \\r\\ndevelopment. Because of their uncomfortable situation, many business \\r\\nfirms have embarked on cost-cutting programs (including the \\r\\nreduction of staffs, of inventories, of advertising, and of capital \\r\\nspending).

Third, unemployment in the rural areas \\r\\nof the district is rising, partially because people who had left for \\r\\nhigher paying jobs in Metropolitan areas are now returning after \\r\\nhaving been laid off.], [The softer labor market conditions have resulted in fewer summer job \\r\\nopportunities for students this year than in the past few years. The \\r\\ntwo reasons that were most often cited for this lack of job \\r\\nopportunities were that construction and tourism, the two major \\r\\nactivities in the district where students usually find work, are \\r\\noperating at lower levels than in the past few years; and a number \\r\\nof employers who are facing squeezes on profits and liquidity are \\r\\nnot hiring summer help as freely as they did in previous summers.], [A number of additional cases which indicate that consumers are \\r\\ndowngrading the quality of their purchases have come to our \\r\\nattention in the past month. Directors from areas in the district \\r\\nwhere tourism is a major industry all report that tourist spending \\r\\nis down significantly from a year ago. At the same time, however, \\r\\ntraffic seems to be about the same as it was last year. Instead of \\r\\nspending money and attending paying attractions, people are relying \\r\\nmore on free accommodations and are traveling with campers rather \\r\\nthan staying in motels. Meanwhile, repair shops for automobiles and \\r\\nother durable goods are reporting record volumes of business; a \\r\\nregional parts distribution center for a major automobile \\r\\nmanufacturer in the twin cities reports that the demand for \\r\\nautomobile parts is so great that its crews are working overtime. \\r\\nAlthough automobile sales in the district are still at depressed \\r\\nlevels, the weakness seems to be centered on the more expensive \\r\\nmodels while the market for lighter, economy models and used autos \\r\\nappears to be relatively strong.], [The greatest evidence of \"price shading\" in the district is at the \\r\\nretail level. In addition to markdowns on automobiles, the directors \\r\\nfelt that retailers were holding sales earlier than usual this \\r\\nsummer and were offering larger discounts. One reason given for this \\r\\nwas that inventories appear to be larger than desired because of the \\r\\ngeneral slowing in retail sales. Retailers are also concerned that \\r\\nthey will \"get stuck\" with merchandise that was ordered before the \\r\\ntruckers' strike and is only now arriving.], [There appears to be very little \"price shading\" for industrial \\r\\ngoods, and directors and officers of the bank cited a number of \\r\\ncases where prices have actually risen in the past few weeks. In \\r\\ngeneral the feeling was that manufacturers do not have adequate \\r\\nmargins with which to cut prices. As one director put it, \"business \\r\\nis hurting but volume at a loss doesn't help.\" Another felt that \\r\\nindustrial suppliers are beginning to drop unprofitable lines. On \\r\\nthe other hand one director indicated that discounts in some \\r\\nconstruction materials are greater now than they were a year ago. He \\r\\nwas careful to point out, however, that list prices have risen \\r\\nduring the past year, and as a result, the net effect on prices is \\r\\nnot clear. He noted that sales efforts among construction materials \\r\\ndistributors have intensified, and that they have improved services \\r\\nincluding schedules in order to increase their sales.], [The slowing in sales along with a decreased availability of funds \\r\\nhas led to an increase in district business failures. The three most \\r\\ncommon characteristics of failing businesses are that they were \\r\\nrelatively young firms, were in industries in which entry is fairly \\r\\neasy, and/or were undercapitalized. Of the 21 failures of which one \\r\\nleading district banker was aware, all could be attributed to one or \\r\\nmore of these factors. One director observed that the number of \\r\\nfailures or near failures in the construction industry has risen in \\r\\nrecent months. The primary cause for this is the lack of working \\r\\ncapital, a problem which is chronic in the industry, but which has \\r\\nbecome increasingly acute because of the large number of recent \\r\\nstrikes and the slowing in construction activity.], [\\r\\n                            We serve the public by pursuing a growing economy and stable financial system that work for all of us., [\\n]]]</td>\n",

The head of a large \\r\\nchain observed, however, that retail stores need an increase of \\r\\nthree to three and one half percent in volume to bring profit up to \\r\\nlast year's level.

The chairman of a large manufacturing firm \\r\\nobserved that inventories were high mainly because business \"is not \\r\\nselling goods as fast as desired,\" although special factors such as \\r\\nthe recent truckers' strike in Chicago had contributed to the \\r\\nbuildup, as had \"a new permanent inflation factor\" that has been \\r\\nbuilt into inventories.], [Most directors seemed to believe the current strains in the \\r\\nfinancial markets did not pose a serious threat to business activity \\r\\nat the present time, although the head of a large New York City bank \\r\\ndeclared he thought there would be \"adverse\" effects, but was unable \\r\\nto judge whether these would be \"serious.\" Despite the near-consensus that there was no immediate threat, a number of directors \\r\\nand other business executives did indicate concern regarding \\r\\nfinancial developments. A banker from upstate New York noted that \\r\\nmany businessmen who have long-term financings in the offing are \\r\\nattempting to arrange standby intermediate or short-term credits as \\r\\npossible alternative solutions to their financing needs. An \\r\\ninvestment banker commented that his firm had been marketing four-to-five year securities for many clients, and that if inflation is \\r\\nnot halted, he sees \"an end to public financing of debt issues.\" A \\r\\nlarge retailer observed that small manufacturers were in serious \\r\\nshape with regard to liquidity; they cannot borrow as easily as very \\r\\nbig concerns, and at the same time big retailers are slower in \\r\\nmaking payments to them than in the past, inasmuch as the discount \\r\\nfor prompt payment is less than the cost of borrowing money. \\r\\nCustomer payments to retail stores were also noted as slower than \\r\\nusual, The head of a New York academic institution declared the long \\r\\ndecline in the stock market had cut gifts to private educational \\r\\ninstitutions and had drastically reduced the market value of \\r\\nholdings of endowed institutions.

City banks have had a slower growth rate during this \\r\\nperiod, with all of the increase being in time deposits. Demand deposits have \\r\\ndeclined, with decreasing individual, corporate, and U.

City banks report \\r\\nmany requests from corporate borrowers to back their commercial paper 100 per \\r\\ncent with lines of credit. These city banks believe the commercial paper market \\r\\nhas stabilized and these lines will not be called upon if additional \\r\\ncatastrophes can be avoided.], [Several large banks in the Kansas and Western Missouri region reported \\r\\nincreasing collection difficulties and a marked increase in voluntary individual \\r\\nbankruptcies. The voluntary bankruptcies were most frequent among credit card \\r\\nusers. In these cases individuals tend to maximize their borrowings from all \\r\\nsources, including credit cards, and then file for bankruptcy.

Several large firms have reported cutting proposed capital investment \\r\\nplans substantially during the past few months to make sure that they would live \\r\\nwithin their cash flow. Although firms may not be able to do all the capital \\r\\nspending they would like, there continues to be a need to replace and update \\r\\nequipment in order to improve productivityâ€”and such spending received first \\r\\npriority.

Until recently, \\r\\nimported crude could be delivered on the east coast at substantially lower \\r\\nprices than could domestic crude. This price differential discouraged domestic \\r\\nexploration for oil. With the recent difficulties in the mid-east, tanker rates \\r\\nhave increased by as much as 300 per cent, and imported crude now sells at about \\r\\n75 cents per barrel above domestic crude on the east coast. Thus, domestic crude \\r\\nprices are under pressure, and at least one oil company has announced price \\r\\nincreases in the Tenth District.], [Business is slow for District farm implement dealers.

This firm's total \\r\\nbusiness is about unchanged from a year ago, with increasing international \\r\\nbusiness about offsetting a definite decline in domestic sales. The decline in \\r\\ndomestic sales is attributed to reduced overtime and lower employment in \\r\\nfactories with vending machines, as vending machine operators drop routes and \\r\\ndefer the purchase of new equipment. There is some concern within the firm that \\r\\ntheir growing international business will be hurt by retaliations against U. S. \\r\\nrestrictions on imports.], [The aircraft industry is having trouble from production down through the \\r\\ntransport phases. Unemployment in Wichita, where the aerospace industry is \\r\\nimportant, is reported in excess of 10 per cent. Tulsa also reports difficulties \\r\\nin the industry.

A \\r\\nvigorous recovery, however, is not anticipated, and the rate of \\r\\ninflation is not expected to slow appreciably. Although they do not \\r\\nforesee large increases, reports from bank directors and officers \\r\\nreveal that District retailers expect their sales to improve during \\r\\nthe second half of the year. Manufacturing sales, on the other hand, \\r\\nare expected to continue sluggish. Corporate profits in the District \\r\\nhave suffered and Ninth District firms are cutting costs in order to \\r\\nrestore earnings. Recent large wage concessions to construction \\r\\nworkers and Teamsters are impeding efforts to cut labor costs. \\r\\nSeveral cases of unwanted inventory accumulation were reported in \\r\\nthe District.], [The consensus of opinion among local business economists is that the \\r\\neconomy is turning around and business conditions will improve \\r\\nduring the latter half of 1970. They do not, however, expect a \\r\\nvigorous recovery, and one economist described the current slowdown \\r\\nand expected recovery as being saucer shaped. He said that the \\r\\ncurrent slowdown has not been as rapid or deep as in earlier post-World War II downturns and that the recovery will not be as sharp as \\r\\nin previous upturns. The rate of inflation is not expected to slow \\r\\nappreciably and interest rates are not expected to fall \\r\\nsignificantly before the end of the year. They also look for \\r\\nbusinessmen to continue to revise downward their capital spending \\r\\nplans this year. A major Minneapolis scientific instrument and \\r\\nordnance manufacturer, for example, reduced its original increase in \\r\\ncapital spending plans by 20 per cent. These economists do not think \\r\\nthat total Government spending will change noticeably. Consequently \\r\\nthey see the stimulus for recovery coming from consumer spending. A \\r\\nbusiness economist representing a national retailer felt that \\r\\nconsumer confidence would be recovered during the last half of the \\r\\nyear. He also stated that consumers financially are in better shape \\r\\nthan in previous downturns and it will be easier for them to resume \\r\\nspending.], [In spite of their relatively optimistic outlook, they felt that the \\r\\neconomy was not out of the woods yet.

They do not look for an unusually large \\r\\nincrease in retail sales, but they do expect it to be better than \\r\\nduring the first half. Women's apparel and automobile sales are big \\r\\nunknowns. Reports disclose that a major Minneapolis retailer is \\r\\nhaving trouble selling midi-length styles. A report from one \\r\\ndirector indicates that consumers are buying cars now to avoid the \\r\\nprice increases on 1971 models this Fall. District manufacturers \\r\\nresponding to our latest industrial expectations survey feel that \\r\\nthe rate of advance in District manufacturing sales will continue \\r\\nsluggish during the remainder of 1970.], [In responding to a question on corporate profits, bank directors and \\r\\nofficers indicated that profits in the Ninth District suffered or at \\r\\nbest held steady during the second quarter, although there were \\r\\nnotable exceptions. In response to this situation numerous examples \\r\\nof cost cutting were cited. An economist for a large national \\r\\nmanufacturer stated that attitudes have changed in his company on \\r\\nwhat constitutes a necessary cost. One large brewery in the Twin \\r\\nCities cut its current advertising budget by $800,000. District \\r\\nemployers have curtailed their utilization of labor through layoffs \\r\\nand overtime reductions, and a large Minneapolis computer \\r\\nmanufacturer instructed each employee to take ten days of unpaid \\r\\nvacation before the end of the year. Cost cutting is also \\r\\nmanifesting itself in reductions in capital spending and inventory \\r\\ncutbacks.], [\\r\\nAlthough reports indicate District businessmen are trying to cut \\r\\ninventories, several cases of unwanted inventory accumulation were \\r\\nreported. One large Twin City manufacturer's inventory increased \\r\\nbecause of overly optimistic sales projections. Reports reveal that \\r\\nthe large retailers and a national mail order house have accumulated \\r\\ninventories because of the trucking strike. They are receiving this \\r\\nsummer' s seasonal merchandise late and are being forced to cut its \\r\\nprice to avoid carrying it over.], [One factor, however, that will impede cost cutting efforts by \\r\\nDistrict businessmen is the recent large wage concessions granted to \\r\\nthe construction workers and Teamsters. As a result of these \\r\\nsettlements, bank directors indicate that unions in their areas are \\r\\nbecoming very aggressive in their wage demands, making the \\r\\nsettlement of some current negotiations difficult.

Nevertheless, no instances were \\r\\nfound in which this had yet led to a curtailment of capital \\r\\nexpenditure plans for the rest of 1970, and corroborating evidence \\r\\nof this is found in the observation of three different commercial \\r\\nbankers that business loan demand had risen to historic highs in the \\r\\nlast week or two at their institutions.

Such weakness as was reported seems concentrated in \\r\\ncorporate CDs and individual demand deposits.

Widespread campus disturbances in \\r\\nthe District have forced a number of universities to close and \\r\\nundoubtedly have had an adverse impact on business conditions in \\r\\nlocal areas. This Bank's regular monthly survey of about 70 large \\r\\nmanufacturing companies in the District reflected the softening in \\r\\nnationwide industrial activity last fall and early winter. Signs of \\r\\na bottoming were evidenced in the survey taken in April, but the May \\r\\nsurvey revealed sharp setbacks during the month of April in key \\r\\nseries such as new orders and shipments and a marked deterioration \\r\\nin employment and the workweek, presumably because of work \\r\\nstoppages. The District's insured unemployment rate, which had been \\r\\nedging moderately upward (from 1 percent last October to 2 percent \\r\\nin late March), jumped one percentage point during April to 3 \\r\\npercent.], [At a meeting of about 40 business economists, held at the Bank on \\r\\nMay 15, there were mixed reports concerning recent price behavior. \\r\\nThe majority maintained that wage-cost pressures, in the face of \\r\\nslack demand, are so great as to make it easy to \"pass on\" higher \\r\\nprices. Some economists, however, reported \"under the table\" \\r\\ndiscounting and price rebates, which presumably are not being \\r\\nrecorded in the official price indexes. Specifically, an economist \\r\\nfrom a major rubber company said his firm's price index for tires, \\r\\nbased on actual transactions prices and reflecting the mix of \\r\\nconsumer purchases, had risen during the past year only about , [], \\r\\none-third as much as the BLS price index for tires. Economists from the \\r\\nchemical industries reported recent weakness in chemical prices and \\r\\nnoted that few chemical products were selling at list prices.], [Other points of interest emerging from the meeting included a report \\r\\nby an economist from a large machine tool company in Cleveland that \\r\\nhis firm was living off backlogs, that business booked in April was \\r\\nonly one-quarter of what they would normally receive at this time of \\r\\nthe year, and that they had not yet booked a single new order in \\r\\nMay. Economists from two major auto companies believed the worst of \\r\\nthe cutback in new car sales and production was over and that, \\r\\nfollowing leveling tendencies in the second and third quarters, \\r\\nsales would recover later in the year. Economists from the steel \\r\\nindustry expect the current favorable trade balance in steel to \\r\\ndeteriorate later in the year, with a strong increase in imports and \\r\\nan easing in exports. On the other hand, the steel industry should \\r\\nsoon begin to feel the effects of hedge buying in anticipation of a \\r\\npossible strike next year.], [Among the comments received from this Bank's directors at a joint \\r\\nboard meeting held on May 14, there were reports that markets for \\r\\nauto components and consumer electronics are becoming softer. One \\r\\ndirector said that one industry in which his firm is a major factor, \\r\\nflat glass, isâ€”and would remainâ€”in the doldrums until auto \\r\\nproduction and construction show improvement, but he was not \\r\\noptimistic. Several directors emphasized that the demand for coal is \\r\\nthe greatest since World War II; stockpiles are low and there is \\r\\ndifficulty in receiving supplies.

One director, \\r\\nthe dean of a graduate school, reported that this year's graduates \\r\\nare harder to place.

A recession is \\r\\nconsidered possible by a number of the board members, but this \\r\\nprospect is causing less concern than inflation since there is a \\r\\nwidespread belief among the directors that a recession would be \\r\\nshort and mild. A liquidity crisis is mentioned as a possibility by \\r\\nonly one-third of the respondents, and the odds attached to this \\r\\noutcome are relatively low. With this overall economic outlook, the \\r\\nboard members expected sales to show no increase or only a small \\r\\nincrease in 1970, while profits are expected to decline. One \\r\\ndirector thought there might be a fall of more than 5 percent in \\r\\nboth sales and profits.], [Every board member reported that employee wages in their firms were \\r\\nbeing increased in 1970. This direct experience with higher wage \\r\\ncosts may be one reason for the almost unanimous concern with \\r\\ninflation, ahead of other economic problems. The smallest wage \\r\\nincrease (4 percent) was cited by an academic leader, while the \\r\\nlargest (10 percent) was mentioned by a banker. The nonbanking \\r\\nbusinessmen mentioned 6 percent most often as the wage adjustment \\r\\nthey were making this year.], [The respondents were unanimous in their view that the Federal budget \\r\\nwould operate with a deficit this year. Apparently, the \\r\\nAdministration's forecast of a budget surplus is not accepted within \\r\\nthe business and financial community, although a few directors \\r\\nthought the deficit might be small.], [Despite some concern about a mild recession, acknowledgment of \\r\\nhigher labor costs, and a generally poor outlook for profits this \\r\\nyear, there were no reports of employment cutbacks by the bankers \\r\\nand businessmen interviewed and no indication that employment cuts \\r\\nwere currently being considered. In fact, plans for very modest \\r\\nexpansion of the labor force were noted by a couple of respondents. \\r\\nThis reported maintenance of employment levels is consistent with \\r\\nthe aggregate data for the Eleventh District, which show total \\r\\nemployment still edging upward. The increase in employment, however, \\r\\nhas not been sufficient to absorb all of the new labor force \\r\\nentrants in the District states. Thus, there has been an increase in \\r\\nunemployment in the Eleventh District since the end of 1969, and \\r\\nunemployment insurance activity is at a considerably higher level.], [The respondents to our survey did note some softening in planned \\r\\nplant and equipment spending. More than half indicated that their \\r\\nJanuary expectations had been revised downward; the estimates of the \\r\\nmagnitude of the downward revision were vague but apparently \\r\\nindicated, in most cases, trimming around the edges rather than \\r\\nwholesale slashing.

Construction contract activity in the District showed \\r\\nrenewed strength in the first quarter of 1970, compared with either \\r\\nthe year-earlier period or the fourth quarter of 1969. Nonbuilding \\r\\nconstruction contracts were up considerably, buoyed by two very \\r\\nlarge contracts; nonresidential contracts also showed a sizable \\r\\nincrease. A seasonal expansion in construction employment has \\r\\noccurred this spring, although the gain came earlier and was \\r\\nsomewhat less than usual.], [Department store sales in the Eleventh District through early May \\r\\nwere up moderately in dollar value, but less than the amount \\r\\nrequired to offset inflation. Sales in early May appeared somewhat \\r\\nstronger than has been the case for the year as a whole so far.], [Agricultural activities throughout most of the Eleventh District are \\r\\nprogressing under generally favorable weather conditions. Cash \\r\\nreceipts from farm marketings in the District states were up \\r\\nsubstantially in the first two months of 1970, compared with year-earlier levels.], [Loan demand in the Eleventh District remained sluggish in April, as \\r\\ntotal loans at weekly reporting commercial banks declined \\r\\ncontraseasonally. With both time and savings deposits increasing, \\r\\nDistrict banks added considerably to their holdings of securities, \\r\\nparticularly municipals.

Perhaps the most pervasive comments revolve about \\r\\nconstruction industry wage settlements. The extremely high national \\r\\nrate of wage increase is mirrored in the District, but of more \\r\\nsignificance, current and emerging wage demands will probably give a \\r\\nnew lift to the national spiral. Construction is at a standstill in \\r\\nsome areas of the District, as new wage bargaining proceeds. \\r\\nExcessive increases in construction costs are an important part of \\r\\nthe reason for the reduced volume of new construction awards, which \\r\\nwill show up in reduced construction activity six months or so \\r\\nhence. Even now, it is reported, there is a virtual absence of small \\r\\nconstruction projects of $750,000 or less.], [The magnitude of wage increases in construction, and in other \\r\\nindustries as well, is causing many to doubt the validity of \\r\\nattempting to bring wage-cost inflation under control by monetary \\r\\nand fiscal policies. There is a strong belief that stabilization \\r\\ngoals can be accomplished only if the unbridled power of labor \\r\\nunions is curbed. In this connection, it was noted that some local \\r\\nmemberships in their push for large gains have effectively \\r\\noverthrown the guidance of national leaders. It was interesting, \\r\\ntoo, to hear that the top construction company in the United States \\r\\nlast year is a nonunion firm.], [Retail sales are reported in the range of from firm to down by \\r\\nvarying amounts. Where sales were reported weak, it was indicated \\r\\nthat the public is deeply concerned about the prospect of recession.], [Despite excellent production prospects, producers of farm crops are \\r\\ndiscouraged by low prices for many of these crops. Bankers in the \\r\\nHigh Plains report that increasing numbers of farmers, particularly \\r\\nwheat farmers, are quitting because of low prices and restricted \\r\\naverage allotment programs. The attrition appears to be \\r\\nsubstantially higher than the average for other recent years caused \\r\\nby the changing structure of the industry. The livestock sector \\r\\ncontinues to remain relatively favorable. However, the impact of \\r\\nhigher livestock prices is expected to be offset by increasing \\r\\ncosts, resulting in little change in net farm income measured in \\r\\ncurrent dollars. Consequently, net farm income measured in real \\r\\nterms is likely to be down.], [The 8-percent increase in net farm income in 1969, combined with \\r\\nefforts of farm producers to increase efficiency by going to larger \\r\\nequipment and other technological improvements, has caused purchases \\r\\nby farmers to increase. Farm machinery dealers report sales of farm \\r\\nequipment to be unusually good. They are fearful, however, that to a \\r\\nconsiderable extent current sales are being made at the expense of \\r\\nnormal future sales. Conversation with farm purchasers indicates \\r\\nthat they are buying now because they expect equipment prices to \\r\\nrise substantially as new union contracts are negotiated.

The other industrialist expected no further declines in \\r\\nthe volume of business. He indicated, though, that he was less \\r\\ncertain about the economy and more confused now than at anytime in \\r\\nhis experience. Further, this industrialist is skeptical about the \\r\\nability of current policy to make much headway against inflation.], [All board members expressed concern over declines in the stock \\r\\nmarket.

If any consensus exists, it is \\r\\nthat the economy has not yet bottomed out and that recovery will be \\r\\nless than spectacular when it comes. According to directors' reports \\r\\nand other sources of information, further weakening in sales, \\r\\nemployment and production is likely. Department stores report lower \\r\\nvolume and growing resistance to higher priced merchandise. Belt \\r\\ntightening by businesses has spread, and directors report many \\r\\ninstances of slowdowns in capital spending. Employment and \\r\\nproduction cutbacks are common.], [[Retail sales], [], \\r\\n Department stores surveyed report no discernible shift \\r\\nfrom the \"upstairs\" to the \"bargain basement\". However, customer \\r\\nresistance to higher priced brands has increased, with lower priced \\r\\nmerchandise receiving the benefit. A canvass of merchants by one of \\r\\nour Branch offices indicated that they expect no improvement in \\r\\nsales within the near future. Regarding auto sales, distributors \\r\\ncontacted report some shifting from larger cars to the compact \\r\\nsized, loaded with optional equipment. Rather than settling for a \\r\\nstripped-down version of a full-sized car, customers are purchasing \\r\\nlower priced equipment-packed models.], [[Belt tightening], [], \\r\\n A profit squeeze is causing many businesses to trim \\r\\nfat wherever possible. Reports of capital expenditures being reduced \\r\\nor stretched out have been coming from several sources. A major \\r\\nairline reports more executives are flying coach, and some companies \\r\\nare pushing early retirements. Attrition is being allowed to take \\r\\nits toll, and the workweek is being reduced in some industrial \\r\\nareas.], [[Production and employment], [], \\r\\n Cutbacksâ€”some sizableâ€”are occurring in \\r\\nsteel, furniture, textiles, and rubber and paper products. A large \\r\\nsteel producer in Alabama and a large aluminum company in Tennessee \\r\\nare reportedly cutting employment by as much as 20 percent. A \\r\\nMississippi furniture manufacturer is reported to be trimming \\r\\nemployment from 2,800 to 1,700. A 500-man cutback is imminent at \\r\\nanother firm, and a District bank is cutting employmentâ€”this one by \\r\\n10 percent across the board. A regional airline is cutting its work \\r\\nforce by 100, \"purely as an economy move\". A shorter workweek has \\r\\nalso been used to adjust output: for example, a major rubber company \\r\\nis going on a four-day week.], [A strike involving 5,000 workers at the Atomic Energy Commission's \\r\\nOak Ridge, Tennessee, plant is entering its third month. Gulf states \\r\\nutilities continue to be picketed, and a walkout involving 1,200 has \\r\\nidled production at a Birmingham plant. The Florida Power and the \\r\\nMiami plumbers' strikes have been settled. The plumbers will receive \\r\\nabout a 25 percent yearly pay boost over the three-year contract. \\r\\nEmployment is stabilizing at two large military installations \\r\\ncontacted. Recent employment cutbacks at these two installations \\r\\nhave been accomplished by normal attrition.], [[Capital spending and construction], [], \\r\\n Major utility construction is \\r\\nstrong and a twenty-story office building will be built in Jackson, \\r\\nMississippi. Despite postponements in capital spending, there have \\r\\nbeen some announcements of new plants and plant expansions, \\r\\nincluding a needle factory in Alabama, a $70 million expansion of a \\r\\nmining and industrial chemical complex in Tennessee, and a $15 \\r\\nmillion expansion of an engine plant in south Alabama.

Their \\r\\ncomments, as given below, are separated on the basis of real versus \\r\\nmonetary markets.], [[Monetary Conditions and Capital Markets], [], \\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Otto Eckstein characterized capital markets as currently \\r\\nbeing in a \"most unusual state\", attributing this to (1) the \\r\\nSystem's switch to aggregate targets, (2) the continuing high rate \\r\\nof inflation and suspicion that it will not abate, and (3) \\r\\nuncertainties wrought by Cambodia andâ€”particularlyâ€”the stock \\r\\nmarket. With respect to the Fed's current stance, Eckstein \\r\\nemphatically pointed out that policy can be judged as having been \\r\\neasier over the last few months only by a monetarist's standards. \\r\\nMeasured from any starting month previous to February 1970, the \\r\\nwidely touted 10 percent annual growth rate of money stock shrinks \\r\\nto 3 to 5 percent. On top of this moderate rate of growth, Eckstein \\r\\ninterprets the events of April and May as having led to a greatly \\r\\nincreased liquidity preference on the part of the public, concluding \\r\\nthat endorsement of a 4 percent rate of monetary growth during the \\r\\ncurrent period is \"really somewhat cavalier\".], [Professor James Tobin concurred with Eckstein on this view of System \\r\\npolicy, additionally pointing out that with a 4 or 5 percent rate of \\r\\ngrowth, money supply is shrinking in real terms. Tobin also voiced \\r\\nfears that the Fed's excessively tight policy in combination with \\r\\nits shift to aggregate targets has forced interest rates to a point \\r\\nwell above the real rate of return on capital, a state of affairs he \\r\\nfeels will depress real activity more than we are bargaining for.], [At the opposite end of the spectrum was Professor Henry Wallich, who \\r\\nstated that Fed policy is threatening to become overly easy \"no \\r\\nmatter how money stock is measured\".], [\\r\\nViews varied also on the causes and the implications of the stock \\r\\nmarket decline. Wallich feels the principal explanation is the \\r\\nnecessary, but painful, adjustment of equity markets to a 9 percent \\r\\nbond market. Tobin, on the other hand, feels the decline has been \\r\\nserious, stating that it will have both wealth and cost of capital \\r\\neffects, and that it is symptomatic of a general economic malaise. \\r\\nWhen viewed from the more regional, micro outlook of our banking \\r\\ndirectors, money market conditions appeared more optimistic. Only a \\r\\nmonth ago all three of our Class A directors were reporting \\r\\ncommercial loan demands at an all-time high at their respective \\r\\ninstitutions. Two now report that this situation has moderated to a \\r\\ndegree where their banks can handle it. Our directors also report a \\r\\nhealthy pickup in deposit inflows over the last three weeks in all \\r\\ncategories, but particularly in consumer-type deposits. Mr. Kennedy \\r\\nnoted that for the first time in 1970, deposit figures at his \\r\\ninstitution are now exceeding year-ago levels. Taken together, these \\r\\nfactors represent a substantial shift toward optimism among our \\r\\nbanking directors from a month ago.], [[GNP and Real Market Aggregates], [], \\r\\n\\r\\nOur academicians shifted positions in their discussion of the \\r\\noutlook in real markets, with Eckstein becoming the most bullish. He \\r\\nsees the economy currently hovering between recession and no growth, \\r\\nbut remains convinced that most of the GNP markdown will occur in \\r\\nthe first half of this year. While he hasn't made a run on his model \\r\\nfor about three weeks now, he sees total 1970 GNP falling in the \\r\\n$982-$985 billion range, with unemployment at 5.0 to 5.2 percent by \\r\\nthe year-end. Eckstein further offered the opinion that, if we do \\r\\nhave a recession (however measured), it will be far and away the \\r\\nmildest of the postwar period.], [Wallich similarly sees 1970 nominal GNP winding up in the $980-$985 \\r\\nbillion range, with a nominal fourth-quarter gain of about $15 \\r\\nbillion. While he identified unemployment, prices, and interest \\r\\nrates as all behaving worse than expected, he expressed confidence \\r\\nthat the nominal GNP forecasts made earlier this year will hold up \\r\\nquite well. Noting how successive capital surveys have shown a \\r\\nconsistency, he does not feel that capital expenditure plans are \\r\\ncollapsing, and he sees the possibility of bringing the GNP deflator \\r\\ndown to a level of 4 percent by the year-end. On the outlook for \\r\\nunemployment in the third and fourth quarters, he was somewhat more \\r\\nbearish than Eckstein.], [Tobin once again provided the most gloomy assessment, predicting \\r\\nunemployment will rise to at least 5 1/2 percent by the year-end, \\r\\nand very possibly higher. He did not provide us with GNP projections \\r\\nfor the next two quarters.], [Again turning to the micro-oriented views of our directors, the \\r\\npicture is quite mixed. Mr. Robertson of the Bangor Punta Corp. \\r\\n(aircraft firearms, recreational equipment, farm products, etc.) \\r\\nreports that sales are continuing a sharp deterioration in nearly \\r\\nall their lines, with the one major exception the capital goods \\r\\nproduced in their process engineering division. Their layoffs have \\r\\nbeen substantial, and capital expenditure plans have been cut back \\r\\n30 to 40 percent. Other directors, however, noted that layoffs seem \\r\\nto have subsided in their areas. Messrs. Cabot (Cabot Corp.) and \\r\\nCarter (Nashua Corp.) report their capital expenditure plans are \\r\\ncontinuing at or near the levels originally planned, althoughâ€”apropos of Tobin's point aboveâ€”Mr. Carter did note that their \\r\\ncapital spending is becoming increasingly contingent upon securing \\r\\nreasonably priced financing. Other queries to our directors produced \\r\\nno shift in sentiment from the views they expressed a month ago.], [\\r\\n                            We serve the public by pursuing a growing economy and stable financial system that work for all of us., [\\n]]]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

The Branch Board members further revealed an overall lack \\r\\nof confidence that monetary and fiscal policy would succeed in \\r\\nbringing inflation under control. They now favor the Federal \\r\\nGovernment's setting up some form of wage-price guidelines to be \\r\\nfollowed voluntarily by business.], [Total nonagricultural employment in the five states of the District \\r\\ncontinued to increase in April, but the slim gain was less than \\r\\nseasonally expected. Manufacturing employment actually declined \\r\\nslightly in April. While widespread employment reductions are not \\r\\nevident in the District, job opportunities, in relation to the labor \\r\\nforce, are not as plentiful as a year ago. The unemployment rate has \\r\\nincreased, and in Texas, for example, initial unemployment insurance \\r\\nclaims are almost twice as high as a year ago. These aggregate data \\r\\ntend to confirm the information given by Board members. Most of the \\r\\nBoard members indicated that employment reductions were not \\r\\nanticipated in their industry, but a comparison of June responses \\r\\nwith those received in May revealed some slight weakening in \\r\\nemployment.], [The seasonally adjusted Texas industrial production index declined \\r\\nin April from the March level and has generally trended downward in \\r\\nrecent months.], [The manufacturing sector, particularly durable goods manufacturing, \\r\\nhas been the source of weakness in the production index. Petroleum \\r\\nmining and refining, however, remained at unusually high levels \\r\\nduring the spring period, avoiding the usual seasonal decline. \\r\\nPetroleum stocks have built up to excessive levels recently, and the \\r\\nregulated oil production allowables in the District are generally \\r\\nlower for June than for May. This is likely to cause some further \\r\\nweakness in Texas industrial production this summer.], [The value of construction contract awards declined in the District \\r\\nin April from the March level, but on a cumulative basis the \\r\\nJanuary-April 1970 level is nearly one-third higher than in the same \\r\\nfour months of 1969. The value of residential construction contracts \\r\\nso far this year has nearly matched the 1969 level, while \\r\\nnonresidential building and nonbuilding construction contracts are \\r\\nsharply higher than in the same four months a year ago. Responses of \\r\\nDistrict Board members indicate that capital spending plans have not \\r\\nbeen curtailed in most of their firms. One Board member in June and \\r\\none in May did report a substantial downward revision in plans for \\r\\nthe current year. These capital spending plans are consistent with \\r\\nthe view of most Board members that sales in their industry are \\r\\neither stabilizing or strengthening at the present time. \\r\\nFurthermore, nearly all the Board members report that corporate \\r\\nplanning in their firms for 1971 is based on the expectation of a \\r\\nmodest increase in sales and profits. Responses indicate that not a \\r\\nsingle Board member expects a decline in sales or profits for 1971.], [Aggregate data opinions of Board members and responses of District \\r\\nretailers all confirm the observation that retail sales have been \\r\\nweak so far this year and the real volume of goods sold has probably \\r\\ndeclined. Sales of department stores in the District were very \\r\\nsluggish during the last two thirds of May, and in some weeks the \\r\\ncurrent-dollar sales actually trailed the figure for the \\r\\ncorresponding weeks a year ago. Department store sales improved \\r\\nnoticeably, however, during the first week in June. Auto dealers in \\r\\nthis District who were contacted recently indicated that the bottom \\r\\nof their , [], \\r\\nwell-known sales decline may have been reached. Sales \\r\\nresults for the first ten days of June indicated to most that the \\r\\ntotal monthly volume might equal or exceed that in June 1969.], [The auto dealers contacted generally felt that their sales weakness \\r\\nwas in total volume and that a noticeable shift in demand to lower \\r\\npriced or lesser equipped cars had not occurred. Nonautomotive \\r\\nretailers are noting some substitution of lower priced for higher \\r\\npriced merchandise. This observation was made mostly by department \\r\\nstore managers, while more specialized retail establishments \\r\\nreported less shift toward lower priced merchandise. Of particular \\r\\nnote was increased consumer attention on specials for specific items \\r\\nor on bargain basement merchandise rather than the regular stock.], [Bank credit at District weekly reporting banks declined in May, as a \\r\\nresult of reductions in both loans and securities holdings. Business \\r\\nloans fell further in May, following declines in each of the \\r\\nprevious four months of 1970.\\r\\n], [Total deposits at the weekly reporting banks also declined in May, \\r\\ncaused mainly by a drop in demand deposits, much of which \\r\\nrepresented reduced holdings by the United States Government. \\r\\nDiscount window borrowings and net purchases of Federal funds by the \\r\\nEleventh District member banks also declined in May.], [\\r\\n                            We serve the public by pursuing a growing economy and stable financial system that work for all of us., [\\n]]]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

At the same time, construction \\r\\nslowdowns, reduced defense activity, and labor strikes have slowed \\r\\nthe economies of some areas.

No evidence was uncovered among major department stores \\r\\nindicating that customers were downgrading quality in their \\r\\npurchases. Rather it seems that customers with higher and more \\r\\nstable income prospects have become relatively more important and \\r\\nare maintaining quality levels.

District investment firms are \\r\\nencountering financial difficulties and, as a result, have had to \\r\\nalter their operations.

They \\r\\nfelt that people are becoming increasingly concerned about inflation \\r\\nand are becoming progressively disenchanted with traditional \\r\\nrestrictive monetary and fiscal policies. As a result, the directors \\r\\nfelt that guidelines would probably be publicly unpopular but in \\r\\nmany cases would be privately welcomed. In general, they thought \\r\\nthat people would prefer to see voluntary controls imposed rather \\r\\nthan new legislation, and that businessmen are more in favor of \\r\\nguidelines than labor leaders. The directors cited a number of\\r\\ninstances where business leaders have voiced approval of some kind \\r\\nof guidelines. The directors also cited cases where labor leaders \\r\\ndid not want to be quoted but were concerned with the large \\r\\nsettlements which have been won by unions in recent labor disputes. \\r\\nBecause of these large settlements, rank and file members are \\r\\nexpecting large wage increases and union leaders are afraid to ask \\r\\nfor less.

A telephone poll of two leading local investment banking \\r\\nfirms explored the implications of these problems in three areas of \\r\\ntheir operations. First, operating staffs of securities brokers have \\r\\nbeen cut back about 15 to 20 percent in the last year. These \\r\\ncutbacks, however, were attributed to the decline in volume of \\r\\ntrading rather than to the current financial crisis. In general, \\r\\nsales staffs have been reduced, with the declines occurring in some \\r\\ninstances through attrition rather than through layoffs. Second, a \\r\\nsecurities brokerage house is closing one of its suburban offices \\r\\nbecause of the lack of volume. In addition, a director was aware of \\r\\na mutual fund in Billings, Montana, which has recently closed down. \\r\\nThird, merger activity among securities brokers appears to be on the \\r\\nupswing. Both investment bankers who were contacted reported that \\r\\nthey had been approached by a number of smaller firms in the last \\r\\nthree months. Although only two mergers have been consummated, these \\r\\nfirms felt that additional mergers could take place in the not-too-distant future.], [Scattered pieces of information continue to show that District \\r\\nmanufacturers are cutting back their capital expenditure plans. Two \\r\\ndirectors cited cases where distributors of heavy equipment to \\r\\nagriculture and construction firms have experienced sharp declines \\r\\nin sales during the past month or so. It was also reported that a \\r\\nlarge retail firm headquartered in the twin cities has cut back its \\r\\ncapital appropriations by about 50 percent. One other director \\r\\nstated that General Motors has scheduled huge cutbacks in capital \\r\\nspending, with each division being asked to curtail capital \\r\\nexpenditures.], [A number of examples have come to light which suggest that consumers \\r\\nare changing their consumption patterns. A Minneapolis-based \\r\\nundergarment manufacturer reports that its sales are 10 to 15 \\r\\npercent below last year's levels. They attribute their poor sales \\r\\nperformance this year to the slowdown in department store sales and \\r\\nfeel that consumers are taking their business to lower priced \\r\\nstores. Automobile dealers in the twin cities report a downturn in \\r\\nauto sales which has been centered primarily in higher priced \\r\\nautomobiles and that sales of basic models are holding up fairly \\r\\nwell. In addition, repair shops for both automobiles and other \\r\\ndurable goods are experiencing sharp increases in business, which \\r\\nsuggest that consumers are tending to hold off on major durables \\r\\npurchases.

The \\r\\ngeneral opinion is that the economy is experiencing a mild slowdown, \\r\\nand there is no expectation of a complete recovery until the end of \\r\\nthe year. At the same time, there is little optimism that inflation \\r\\nwill be brought under control quickly. Consumer demand continues to \\r\\nbe high, although sales are somewhat slower than last year, and \\r\\nthere is continued demand upon banks for credit. The adverse effects \\r\\nof the slowdown appear in two principal forms. Unemployment is seen \\r\\nto be much higher this year, and many firms report experiencing a \\r\\nprofit squeeze. They say that they are unable to offset by price \\r\\nincreases or greater sales volume their higher costs. In \\r\\nconsequence, they are attempting to cut expenses by reducing staffs, \\r\\ncutting inventories, and delaying capital protects.], [Unemployment has risen in most parts of the District. The highest \\r\\nlevels are in the Pacific Northwest where the principal problems are \\r\\ncentered in the lumber industry and Boeing Aircraft. Boeing is the \\r\\nprincipal employer in the Seattle-Tacoma area, and it has cut its \\r\\nemployment from over 100,000 in 1968 to 58,000 now, with further \\r\\nlayoffs announced for the rest of this year to reduce the level to \\r\\n43,000. Lumber operations have been at a reduced pace throughout \\r\\nmuch of Washington and Oregon. Apparently the smaller mills are \\r\\nbearing the major burden, while the large integrated mills continue \\r\\nto maintain production. There is some expectation of a recovery, at \\r\\nleast in Oregon, toward the end of the year. The other area with a \\r\\nmajor unemployment problem is southern California, where the \\r\\naffected industries are aerospace and, to a less extent, housing.], [Construction of new residential housing and the opening of new \\r\\nsubdivisions continue to be slow. The decline in demand is heaviest \\r\\nin the Seattle area because of the layoffs at Boeing. The principal \\r\\nstrength is in commercial construction. This is certainly the case \\r\\nin California where commercial building remains high. In many cases \\r\\nthere is also a strong demand for mobile homes. This particular \\r\\nchange may be part of a tendency for consumers to downgrade the \\r\\nquality of their housing demand.\\r\\n], [Retail sales remain relatively steady despite the rising \\r\\nunemployment, and they continue to be a source of strength in most \\r\\nareas. For most kinds of consumer goods, there is no sign of \\r\\ndowngrading in choice of items as a means of economizing. Consumers \\r\\nare reported to be more careful in watching for and responding to \\r\\nsales, but there is no pronounced shift to lower grade goods. When \\r\\npurchases of major appliances are made, the demand is still for the \\r\\n\\r\\n  higher-grade line. Replies from major department stores indicate the \\r\\ngeneral composition of their business is not changed, although sales \\r\\nare not rising at last year's pace.], [There is one major exception to this picture. Reports from \\r\\nthroughout the District indicate that consumers are economizing on \\r\\ntheir automobile purchases. They are shifting away from middle-line \\r\\nmodels to lower priced and foreign economy cars, although luxury car \\r\\ndemand remains high. As part of this shift, there appears to be an \\r\\nincreased demand for late model used cars. Therefore, there is \\r\\nevidence of both a reduction of automobile purchases and a \\r\\ndowngrading of quality of purchases.], [The recent decline in the stock market has not had any noticeable \\r\\nimpact on consumer purchases, but it does seem to contribute toward \\r\\ncreating more general uncertainty on the part of businessmen. One \\r\\nspecific example of the effect of lower stock prices reported is \\r\\nthose cases where stock had been used as loan collateral and the \\r\\nborrowers were forced to sell at a loss to cover the loan.], [Many businesses report that their profit margins are being narrowed \\r\\nby higher costs, especially labor costs and by an inability to raise \\r\\ntheir revenue. Sales are not rising to offset the costs, and general \\r\\nprice increases are not always feasible. In consequence, there is \\r\\nmore emphasis upon cost reductions. This takes various forms: closer \\r\\ncontrols over inventories, increased layoffs of employees, and in \\r\\nsome cases postponement of capital projects. In fact, one of the \\r\\nclearest responses of individual businesses to this combination of \\r\\nsmaller profit margins and continued high interest rates appears in \\r\\nthe reduction of capital spending. One large oil company, for \\r\\nexample, describes its projects as being continuously reviewed, and \\r\\nseveral other manufacturing companies report a postponement and \\r\\nreduction of planned expenditures.], [Financial pressures are also an element in the slowing of business \\r\\ncapital expenditures. Several companies reported credit stringency \\r\\nand high interest costs as factors leading to a revision in their \\r\\nplans. In one case, foreign financial conditions caused difficulties \\r\\nfor one company; foreign banks were unable to supply funds normally \\r\\nutilized by this business. Financial conditions continue to be cited \\r\\nas an important adverse factor influencing the construction \\r\\nindustry. This is in spite of deliberate efforts by banks to \\r\\nallocate funds to meet this demand. Banks are continuing to be \\r\\nselected in the kinds of loans that they make.], [In summary, reports of our directors and other businessmen point to \\r\\na slowing of the pace of economic activity and a greater reluctance \\r\\non their part to undertake major expenditures in the near future.], [\\r\\n                            We serve the public by pursuing a growing economy and stable financial system that work for all of us., [\\n]]]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

In virtually all Districts, \\r\\nunemployment is rising, and in many, labor markets are easing \\r\\nnoticeably. Retail trade is weaker almost everywhere, and consumers \\r\\nare \"downgrading\" and \\r\\nbargain-hunting. A few Districts report large \\r\\ncuts in capital spending. In a number of Districts, special note was \\r\\nmade of the profit squeeze that is affecting many businesses, and in \\r\\nsome, concern was expressed about a decline in corporate liquidity. \\r\\nMention was again made in several Districts of the dangers from wage \\r\\nand price developments, and in four Districts a substantial number \\r\\nof respondents reportedly favor some sort of incomes policy.], [In only one Federal Reserve District, St. Louis, was recent economic \\r\\nactivity regarded as \"good\"; and in Kansas City it was deemed fair \\r\\nto good. In most Districts, activity has weakened significantly, and \\r\\na decline in new orders was noted in three Districts. Expectations \\r\\nof a further decline are widespread. These range, however, from the \\r\\nbelief that the bottom will come in the third or fourth quarter of \\r\\nthis year, to the belief of the directors of the Cleveland Federal \\r\\nReserve Bank that the contraction will be \"more prolonged and deeper \\r\\nthan most economists and public policy makers are currently \\r\\nexpecting\".], [A growth in unemployment is noticeable throughout the country, in \\r\\nsome Districts only mildly, but in others strongly. Until recently, \\r\\nmany firms were reducing their work forces simply by letting \\r\\n\"attrition\" take its toll, but now firms are \"furloughing\" workers, \\r\\n\"cutting back\" their staffs, and \"pushing\" early retirements. In a. \\r\\nfew Districts, even \"quality\" labor has begun to be available. An \\r\\neasier market is noted for, among others, \"middle management\" and \\r\\n\"professional\" types and one District remarked upon an \"extremely \\r\\nsharp increase\" in unsolicited summaries from applicants with \\r\\n\"extensive experience\".], [Very few exceptions were noted to the general pattern of weakness in \\r\\nretail sales and of \"downgrading\" and bargain hunting. Department \\r\\nstores seemed to be particularly hard hit by the softening of \\r\\ndemand, while discount stores and \"bargain basements\" were holding \\r\\nup well. Weakness was particularly strong in furniture, appliances, \\r\\ntelevision sets, and clothing. Auto buying was an area where \\r\\n\"downgrading\" was especially intenseâ€”except in Dallas. The trend \\r\\nwas heavily to cheaper models, stripped-down models, \"compacts\", \\r\\nlow-priced imports, and late-model used cars. Outside the auto \\r\\nfield, in the few Districts where no \"downgrading\" was apparent, \\r\\nconsumers nevertheless had a sharp eye out for \"sales\" and \\r\\n\"specials\". In the San Francisco District, a \"strong\" demand for \\r\\nmobile homes was interpreted as possibly a form of \"downgrading\".], [In two Districts, Richmond and St. Louis, capital spending plans \\r\\ncontinue strong, out of \"fear\" of inflation or to offset increased \\r\\nlabor costs. However, in the five other Districts that made \\r\\nreference to the subject, many firms are making substantial \\r\\ncutbacks. Among the comments: General Motors is making \"huge\" \\r\\ncutbacks, a \"large retail organization\" is cutting back by 50 \\r\\npercent, a \"large oil company\" is \"continuously\" reviewing its \\r\\nplans, in the Philadelphia District there has been a \"marked\" \\r\\ncutback since April, and in the New York District some firms are \\r\\nreviewing their plans for the \"second or third time this year\".], [Inventory holdings were specifically mentioned by half of the \\r\\nDistricts. They were regarded as \"excessive\" in two of the \\r\\nDistricts, and were being \"reduced\" in a third. In two others they \\r\\nwere at a \"satisfactory\" level, partly because firms were working on \\r\\na \"hand-to-mouth\" basis. In another District, reference was to \\r\\nmerchandising firms, which were being \"extremely cautious\" regarding \\r\\ntheir fall and winter stocks.], [The profit squeeze is hitting many businesses very hard in many \\r\\nparts of the country. The situation is aggravated by a liquidity \\r\\nsqueeze. Slow payment on accounts receivable was mentioned by both \\r\\nChicago and New York as one of the reasons for this latter \\r\\ndevelopment. Because of their uncomfortable situation, many business \\r\\nfirms have embarked on cost-cutting programs (including the \\r\\nreduction of staffs, of inventories, of advertising, and of capital \\r\\nspending). In the New York District, it was reported that many \\r\\ncompanies may not be able to \"meet their maturities\" and that some \\r\\n\"substantial\" companies would be unable to \"meet their payrolls \\r\\nwithout refinancing\". The liquidity squeeze is having repercussions \\r\\nin the commercial paper market. Some commercial paper dealers have \\r\\ntold corporate customers they can no longer handle their issues. \\r\\nAmong financial concerns that are troubled by their own liquidity \\r\\nsituation are some life insurance companies. The latter were \\r\\nreported as wishing to increase their liquidity and therefore not \\r\\nseeking any new long-term investment outlets.], [Concern about continuing inflationary pressures, particularly \\r\\narising from large wage hikes, was mentioned in several Districts, \\r\\nalthough some price declines were noted in Cleveland (machine tool \\r\\nand aluminum industries) and in Richmond (textiles and furniture). \\r\\nRespondents in some Districts expressed disillusionment with \\r\\n\"conventional\" stabilization measures or with the \"Administration's \\r\\neconomic policies\", and a few Districts reported there was \\r\\nconsiderable sentiment in favor of some kind of incomes policy. In \\r\\none District it was reported that some labor leaders noted \\r\\nconfidentially that guidelines would provide them with\"an excuse to \\r\\nargue for lower wage settlements\" than their members are currently \\r\\nready to consider.], [\\r\\n                            We serve the public by pursuing a growing economy and stable financial system that work for all of us., [\\n]]]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

A \\r\\ndefinite easing appears to have developed in the commercial banking \\r\\nsector, while our contacts in both the academic and manufacturing \\r\\nspheres now seem more convinced that the economic slowdown is \\r\\nbottoming out. In line with this general outlook, we were able to \\r\\nfind no reports of price shading at any level of business activity.], [All of our banking directors report that commercial loan demand has \\r\\ndeclined considerably since the historic highs of late spring, and \\r\\nthey characterize deposits in all categories as holding at good to \\r\\nexcellent levels. One banker director reports moderate success in \\r\\nthe large CD area following the relief given in June. He also \\r\\nreports, however, that his institution is having to nurse along an \\r\\nunusually large number of outstanding commercial loans on which \\r\\nfirms have fallen behind due to severe liquidity problems.], [Layoffs have definitely abated among the New England region's \\r\\nindustrial producers, and, while the near-term profit outlook \\r\\ncontinues dim for firms in this sector, signs of any major cut-backs \\r\\nin capital expenditure plans for 1971 have yet to develop. This is \\r\\napparently explained by the continuing production capacity problems \\r\\nreported by several of our respondents in manufacturing, and their \\r\\nexpectations for even heavier demands over 1971. Relative to the \\r\\nearnings picture in New England manufacturing, our contacts \\r\\nuniformly report rather poor or no success in passing along their \\r\\ncost increases. With lower internal flows and continued stringency \\r\\nin external financing arrangements, these firms are scrambling hard \\r\\nto maintain plant and equipment investment at the desired high \\r\\nlevels.], [Reports on retail activity in the region are rather more mixed, with \\r\\nsome areas reporting satisfactory volume and others reporting very \\r\\nslow sales. The impression emerges, however, that in almost all \\r\\nareas, retail sales of consumer durables have been hit hardest by \\r\\nthe slowdown.], [Professor Henry Wallich still expects a nominal GNP for the year of \\r\\n$980-983 billion, the same figure he mentioned earlier in the \\r\\nsummer. He expects declining interest rates to combine with a \\r\\nslowing of the rate of inflation to produce a substantial increase \\r\\nin the quantity of money demanded. Thus, he concludes the system \\r\\nshould reasonably pursue a 6 percent rate of money stock growth over \\r\\nthe rest of 1970. Professor Otto Eckstein concurs in this outlook \\r\\nfor GNP, now forecasting $982 billion for the year. He feels that \\r\\nrecent developments have largely offset each other in terms of \\r\\noverall economic impact. On the negative side, he attaches \\r\\nimportance to the decline in construction contracts and the sharp \\r\\ndrop in prime defense contracts. He further expects manufacturing \\r\\ninvestment to be well under current levels next year. On the plus \\r\\nside, however, are the final cessation of the truck strike, the \\r\\nturnaround in auto sales, and the largest jump in history in utility \\r\\nappropriations.], [The one major difference between Wallich and Eckstein seems to be \\r\\ntheir outlook on the future course of unemployment rates. A month \\r\\nago, Professor Wallich cautiously suggested we might reach 5-1/2 \\r\\npercent by year-end. He now is suggesting that something in the \\r\\nrange of 5-1/2 to 6 percent seems quite likely.

The Bank's most recent survey of manufacturers in \\r\\nthe district (expressed in the form of diffusion indexes) show \\r\\nrebounds in new orders and shipments during June, and a sharp \\r\\ndecline in inventories, Employment stabilized, after declining since \\r\\nlast autumn.

The \\r\\nfollowing conclusions emerged from our informal survey: (1) sales \\r\\nhave been weakening for district businesses; (2) there is widespread \\r\\nevidence that merchandise is being sold below posted list prices; \\r\\n(3) the commercial paper market is regarded as relatively stable, \\r\\nbut banks have accommodated and expect to further accommodate firms \\r\\nthat have been borrowers in the commercial paper market; (4) large \\r\\nCD rates are up at some banks, with rates at a few small banks \\r\\nexceeding 9 percent; (5) corporate liquidity is still a major \\r\\nconcern; and (6) loan demand remains strong, matching or exceeding \\r\\nseasonal expectations.], [The nonbankers noted that sales appeared to weaken somewhat in their \\r\\nindustries in recent weeks. Despite the trend in sales, most \\r\\nrespondents noted that their inventory situation had remained \\r\\nsatisfactory so that no change in inventory policy had been \\r\\nnecessary. There was an indication (confirmed by aggregate data for \\r\\nthe region) that petroleum inventories were too high at present, \\r\\neven though sales of the petroleum industry have remained strong. \\r\\nRecent reductions have been made in district petroleum production \\r\\nallowables, particularly in Texas, to curtail crude petroleum \\r\\nmining. The petroleum inventory situation may also improve because a \\r\\nshortage of tankers and reduced Libyan production has caused some \\r\\nstrengthening of domestic demand.], [The respondents were nearly unanimous in citing that , [], \\r\\n  price-cutting \\r\\nfrom posted list prices had occurred in their industries. It was \\r\\nfurther indicated that this practice has been on the increase in \\r\\nrecent weeks. Price-cutting has probably been one response to the \\r\\nweakening sales reported in several industries. One district banker \\r\\nsuggested that a form of price-cutting had been on the increase in \\r\\nthe banking industry. This was occurring through the use of gift \\r\\npremiums, reducing the size of the minimum balance required to avoid \\r\\na checking account service charge, and other innovative promotions \\r\\nto attract deposits.\\r\\n], [A series of questions were asked pertaining to recent developments \\r\\nin the commercial paper market. Nonbankers who have been active in \\r\\nthe commercial paper market, either as issuers or as buyers, \\r\\nreported no change in recent weeks in their activity or in their \\r\\npolicies toward the commercial paper market. Several bankers in the \\r\\narea, however, noted that they had recently accommodated borrowers \\r\\nwho were in the commercial paper market. Of particular note was the \\r\\nrecent accommodation by one banker of finance companies that were \\r\\nknown to utilize the commercial paper market. In addition, several \\r\\nbankers mentioned that they had outstanding lines of credit to \\r\\ncompanies that were in the commercial paper market and anticipated \\r\\nsome additional activation of these lines of credit in the near \\r\\nfuture.], [Banking respondents to our latest survey noted a generally strong \\r\\nloan demand. All reported loan demand to be either exceeding or \\r\\nmatching seasonal expectations. The source of this loan demand is \\r\\napparently from general business, but large real estate development \\r\\nprojects were particularly singled out by one banker.], [The recent change in Regulation Q rates for large denomination CD's \\r\\nwith maturities of 30 to 89 days has brought mixed responses from \\r\\ndistrict bankers. About half of our survey respondents reported that \\r\\nthey had increased their offering rates (usually to the 7 1/2 - 8 \\r\\npercent range, but exceeding 9 percent at a few small banks) while \\r\\nhalf reported they had not changed their rates. Of the bankers who \\r\\nhad increased rates on CD's, only one reported any reduced reliance \\r\\non sources of borrowed funds, such as Eurodollars, commercial paper, \\r\\nor federal funds. To the extent that additional funds are being \\r\\nattracted to district banks by the higher CD rates, it appears these \\r\\nfunds are being utilized to make new loan or investment commitments \\r\\nand not to reduce reliance on borrowed sources of funds.

Meanwhile, repair shops for automobiles and \\r\\nother durable goods are reporting record volumes of business; a \\r\\nregional parts distribution center for a major automobile \\r\\nmanufacturer in the twin cities reports that the demand for \\r\\nautomobile parts is so great that its crews are working overtime. \\r\\nAlthough automobile sales in the district are still at depressed \\r\\nlevels, the weakness seems to be centered on the more expensive \\r\\nmodels while the market for lighter, economy models and used autos \\r\\nappears to be relatively strong.], [The greatest evidence of \"price shading\" in the district is at the \\r\\nretail level. In addition to markdowns on automobiles, the directors \\r\\nfelt that retailers were holding sales earlier than usual this \\r\\nsummer and were offering larger discounts. One reason given for this \\r\\nwas that inventories appear to be larger than desired because of the \\r\\ngeneral slowing in retail sales. Retailers are also concerned that \\r\\nthey will \"get stuck\" with merchandise that was ordered before the \\r\\ntruckers' strike and is only now arriving.], [There appears to be very little \"price shading\" for industrial \\r\\ngoods, and directors and officers of the bank cited a number of \\r\\ncases where prices have actually risen in the past few weeks. In \\r\\ngeneral the feeling was that manufacturers do not have adequate \\r\\nmargins with which to cut prices. As one director put it, \"business \\r\\nis hurting but volume at a loss doesn't help.\" Another felt that \\r\\nindustrial suppliers are beginning to drop unprofitable lines. On \\r\\nthe other hand one director indicated that discounts in some \\r\\nconstruction materials are greater now than they were a year ago. He \\r\\nwas careful to point out, however, that list prices have risen \\r\\nduring the past year, and as a result, the net effect on prices is \\r\\nnot clear. He noted that sales efforts among construction materials \\r\\ndistributors have intensified, and that they have improved services \\r\\nincluding schedules in order to increase their sales.], [The slowing in sales along with a decreased availability of funds \\r\\nhas led to an increase in district business failures. The three most \\r\\ncommon characteristics of failing businesses are that they were \\r\\nrelatively young firms, were in industries in which entry is fairly \\r\\neasy, and/or were undercapitalized. Of the 21 failures of which one \\r\\nleading district banker was aware, all could be attributed to one or \\r\\nmore of these factors. One director observed that the number of \\r\\nfailures or near failures in the construction industry has risen in \\r\\nrecent months. The primary cause for this is the lack of working \\r\\ncapital, a problem which is chronic in the industry, but which has \\r\\nbecome increasingly acute because of the large number of recent \\r\\nstrikes and the slowing in construction activity.], [\\r\\n                            We serve the public by pursuing a growing economy and stable financial system that work for all of us., [\\n]]]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

While it was thought the current strains in the \\r\\nfinancial markets did not pose a serious immediate threat to \\r\\nbusiness activity, considerable concern was expressed regarding \\r\\nbusiness liquidity.], [Only two of the Federal Reserve Bank Directors who attended the \\r\\nearly July meetings at New York and Buffalo were aware of any price \\r\\nshading by manufacturers, but more directors mentioned other signs \\r\\nof an improvement in the overall price situation. These included \\r\\nannounced price cuts, particularly at the retail level, as well as \\r\\nprice shading at the retail level by giving the customer greater \\r\\nvalue. With regard to, [],  \\r\\nunder-the-counter price adjustments, it was \\r\\nreported that Bethlehem Steel Corporation had taken a strong \\r\\nposition against such a marketing practice. As for announced cuts by \\r\\nmanufacturers, one director noted receiving an announcement of a \\r\\nthree percent reduction in the price of cans for packaging \\r\\nbeverages. At the retail level, there has been considerable price \\r\\ncutting by automobile dealers as well as by other retail outlets, \\r\\nwith the aim of either reducing inventories or building sales \\r\\nvolume.], [Retail store sales reportedly were holding up well, except at downtown stores and during night shopping hours. Sales apparently were \\r\\nbeing bolstered by aggressive merchandising. The head of a large \\r\\nchain observed, however, that retail stores need an increase of \\r\\nthree to three and one half percent in volume to bring profit up to \\r\\nlast year's level. Contributing to this need were higher costs \\r\\nstemming from increases in wage rates, in shipping charges, and in \\r\\nshoplifting.\\r\\n], [The directors were virtually unanimous in believing that the more \\r\\ncautious capital spending pattern that apparently has developed in \\r\\nrecent months will continue into 1971. New programs were being \"very \\r\\ncarefully reviewed,\" and many projects were being slowed down or \\r\\nindefinitely deferred. However, projects for which commitments are \\r\\ntoo far along to be canceled or postponed are being completed, as \\r\\nprobably will be projects designed to cut production costs and \\r\\nincrease productivity. Although an upstate New York banker remarked \\r\\nthat there were no signs of cutback in his area, he observed that \\r\\nmost of the capital spending there was on construction for \\r\\nmunicipalities and school districts, for which firm contracts had \\r\\nbeen arranged \"long ago.\" On the other hand, a community college \\r\\nconstruction project for which bids were recently obtained may have \\r\\nto be canceled because the bids are so far above the original \\r\\nestimates.], [\\r\\nThe few comments made on the inventory situation suggested that \\r\\ninventories were higher than were desired. A New York banker \\r\\ncommented that inventories in general are eight to ten percent above \\r\\na year ago, and that increased inventories were particularly evident \\r\\nin the soft goods area. The chairman of a large manufacturing firm \\r\\nobserved that inventories were high mainly because business \"is not \\r\\nselling goods as fast as desired,\" although special factors such as \\r\\nthe recent truckers' strike in Chicago had contributed to the \\r\\nbuildup, as had \"a new permanent inflation factor\" that has been \\r\\nbuilt into inventories.], [Most directors seemed to believe the current strains in the \\r\\nfinancial markets did not pose a serious threat to business activity \\r\\nat the present time, although the head of a large New York City bank \\r\\ndeclared he thought there would be \"adverse\" effects, but was unable \\r\\nto judge whether these would be \"serious.\" Despite the near-consensus that there was no immediate threat, a number of directors \\r\\nand other business executives did indicate concern regarding \\r\\nfinancial developments. A banker from upstate New York noted that \\r\\nmany businessmen who have long-term financings in the offing are \\r\\nattempting to arrange standby intermediate or short-term credits as \\r\\npossible alternative solutions to their financing needs. An \\r\\ninvestment banker commented that his firm had been marketing four-to-five year securities for many clients, and that if inflation is \\r\\nnot halted, he sees \"an end to public financing of debt issues.\" A \\r\\nlarge retailer observed that small manufacturers were in serious \\r\\nshape with regard to liquidity; they cannot borrow as easily as very \\r\\nbig concerns, and at the same time big retailers are slower in \\r\\nmaking payments to them than in the past, inasmuch as the discount \\r\\nfor prompt payment is less than the cost of borrowing money. \\r\\nCustomer payments to retail stores were also noted as slower than \\r\\nusual, The head of a New York academic institution declared the long \\r\\ndecline in the stock market had cut gifts to private educational \\r\\ninstitutions and had drastically reduced the market value of \\r\\nholdings of endowed institutions.

The chairman of a large mutual savings bank \\r\\nremarked, late in June, that although official figures indicate a \\r\\nrecent pick-up in deposits at thrift institutions, there is no \\r\\nevidence of such a movement in New York City. He thought that most \\r\\nof the deposit money that was being withdrawn was probably going \\r\\ninto bonds.

Most of them see a slowdown in the pace of economic \\r\\nactivity with no sign of any quick upswing, but few report any \\r\\nfeeling that the slowdown will worsen. Both prices and costs are \\r\\nexpected to show further increases, and price shading is not \\r\\nwidespread. The area with the most severe problems in terms of \\r\\nunemployment continues to be the Pacific Northwest, where both the \\r\\naircraft and lumber industries continue to reduce employment. \\r\\nDirectors who are associated with the lumber industry report that \\r\\ncompanies are curtailing production, with many firms on a four-day \\r\\nweek and usually with only one shift. In Oregon, it is reported, the \\r\\nmajority of the small mills have been shut down for over two months \\r\\nand many may never reopen. Even some large firms dependent upon \\r\\npublic timber are having difficulties, and one director forecast \\r\\nthat some large firms would be out of business by spring.], [Another area with above-average unemployment is Southern California. \\r\\nThe aircraft and defense industries are suffering the most, but \\r\\ntheir relative impact on that area's economy is smaller than in the \\r\\nNorthwest, and total economic activity in Southern California \\r\\nremains strong. A large electronics manufacturer in the San \\r\\nFrancisco area has reduced its workweek in response to a fall in \\r\\norders. It chose this method of reducing output rather than having \\r\\nlayoffs and risking losing skilled employees. Declines in \\r\\nmanufacturing, mainly machinery and electrical goods, are also \\r\\nreported for Arizona, where total employment declined for the first \\r\\ntime since January. Unemployment is higher in Alaska, in part \\r\\nbecause of a slowdown in the oil field development.], [Prices continue to rise, with the notable exception of lumber and \\r\\nplywood prices. Consumer demand remains steady, although where \\r\\nunemployment is high the sustaining effect of unemployment payments \\r\\nmay disappear as benefits are used up. Therefore retail sales may \\r\\nfall more in such areas. Another unfavorable aspect noted by one \\r\\ndirector is the increase in the number of personal bankruptcies.], [Businesses continue to face a squeeze on their profitsâ€”especially \\r\\nthose now experiencing substantial wage demands. Retailers are \\r\\ndescribed in some cases as reluctant to maintain margins by \\r\\nincreasing prices. There is continued emphasis on cutting costs. As \\r\\npart of this trend, bankers report reduced demand for loans to \\r\\nsupport inventories. In some industries, prospective labor problems \\r\\nadd to uncertainty.], [\\r\\nThe oil industry has some difficulties in controlling discounting of \\r\\ngasoline on the retail level, despite withdrawal of temporary dealer \\r\\nallowances. In addition, it has some supply problems caused by the \\r\\nloss of Arabian crude oil supplies due to the shutdown of the Trans-Arabian pipeline and cutbacks in Libyan oil production. There are \\r\\nalso uncertainties about the future need for the production of \\r\\nunleaded gasoline.], [\\r\\nIn agriculture the picture is mixed. Cattle prices continue to hold, \\r\\nbut there is weakness in some areas dependent upon fruits and \\r\\nvegetables, such as Washington and Southern California. The decline \\r\\nin citrus production is not expected to be compensated by higher \\r\\nprices. In Washington, packers are operating at below capacity. But \\r\\na favorable factor is the recent signing of union contracts by grape \\r\\ngrowers in the Central California Valley.

In most Districts, however, the general tone of the \\r\\ncomment is less pessimistic than a month ago. While some Reserve \\r\\nBanks report a further softening of activity through June and early \\r\\nJuly, most indicate a growing consensus among businessmen that the \\r\\nworst of the latest decline has passed and that the economy is now \\r\\nbottoming out. Expressions of concern over the state of corporate \\r\\nliquidity continue numerous and apprehensions over the possibility \\r\\nof serious financial disorders persist. But on both counts, fears \\r\\nappear to be distinctly less pronounced than at the time of the last \\r\\nFOMC meeting.], [Of the 12 Reserve Banks, Boston characterizes the tenor of business \\r\\ncomment in its District as \"markedly more optimistic than a month \\r\\nago\" and is joined by Atlanta in emphasizing elements of strength in \\r\\nthe local business picture. Cleveland also notes a marked \\r\\nimprovement in June, attributed mainly to the termination of strike \\r\\nactivity, but indicates a distinctly pessimistic outlook for July \\r\\nand for the near-term future. In the remaining Districts, comment on \\r\\ncurrent conditions is predominantly bearish. St. Louis, which last \\r\\nmonth characterized current conditions as \"good,\" now reports \"some \\r\\ndampening of optimism in recent weeks.\" Reports from Minneapolis and \\r\\nDallas also suggest some further softening of activity as compared \\r\\nwith a month ago. As for the outlook for the rest of the year, \\r\\nsentiment in most Districts appears to be veering increasingly \\r\\ntowards a belief that recovery from the current decline will be \\r\\ngradual and that only a modest business expansion can be expected.], [Comments on business spending suggest some further cutbacks or \\r\\nstretch-outs in capital plans of manufacturers and retailers. \\r\\nSpecific reference to such cutbacks or stretch-outs is made in the \\r\\nreports from New York, Atlanta, Cleveland, and St. Louis, with \\r\\nChicago noting declines in the orders of capital goods producers. \\r\\nThe St. Louis report, which indicates cutbacks only among retailers, \\r\\nis notable for its contrast with the bullish outlook for capital \\r\\nplans reported by that District in the last Redbook. Boston and \\r\\nRichmond continue to report no substantial evidence of any \\r\\nsignificant scaling down of capital plans. About half the Districts \\r\\nindicate some degree of inventory excess, with four reporting \\r\\ninventories as higher than desired while others say that businessmen \\r\\nare actively holding the line on inventories. Cleveland's latest \\r\\nsurvey shows a sizable reduction in stocks in June and San Francisco \\r\\nreports that business demand for inventory loans has fallen off.], [Consumer demand is indicated as less than buoyant in a number of \\r\\nDistricts, although New York notes that retail buying seems fairly \\r\\nwell sustained. San Francisco reports that personal bankruptcies are \\r\\nincreasing and that retail sales in the Twelfth District are likely \\r\\nto decline. An apparent increase in the rate of saving by consumers \\r\\nis noted in the Philadelphia District, while Minneapolis and \\r\\nRichmond report some downgrading in the quality of consumer \\r\\npurchases. Other Districts describe the demand for automobiles as \\r\\nconcentrated mainly in the less expensive models.], [Comment on the employment situation is most bearish in St. Louis, \\r\\nChicago, and Minneapolis, where major firms are said to have stopped \\r\\nall hiring or to be considering additional layoffs. Philadelphia \\r\\nalso expects further increases in unemployment and San Francisco \\r\\nreports the continuation of serious unemployment in the Pacific \\r\\nNorthwest, with some increases in layoffs in Southern California and \\r\\nArizona.

Most frequently mentioned items on which some shading is \\r\\nnoted include industrial goods, such as some chemicals, lumber, \\r\\nsteel, and nonferrous metals. Other items cited are synthetic \\r\\nfibers, glass, lubricants, and large capital items. Among consumer \\r\\ngoods, automobiles and large appliances are mentioned. Some easing \\r\\nof prices is evident, especially in the New York District, but \\r\\nChicago reports that some prices are higher and Cleveland says that \\r\\nmost prices are \"firm or firming upward.\" San Francisco and St. \\r\\nLouis report that inflationary expectations continue strong among \\r\\nbusinessmen.], [Most District reports mention corporate liquidity as a serious \\r\\nproblem, but none describe it as critical.

Steel production for the \\r\\nthird quarter, largely reflecting demand from auto companies, is expected to be \\r\\nslightly above the second quarter after allowance for the normal summer \\r\\nslowdown. Several local labor-management disputes in the Cleveland area have \\r\\nbeen settled at high cost. District bankers report they expect loan demand to \\r\\nremain strong and money market conditions to stay comfortable in the immediate \\r\\nfuture. Several of our Branch Directors expect the economy to remain sluggish in \\r\\nthe foreseeable future.], [Economic activity in the District improved significantly in June after the \\r\\ntermination of major strikes, and preliminary and limited data suggest that \\r\\nactivity remained at about the same level in July. The District's insured \\r\\nunemployment rate was essentially unchanged in July, and steel production rose \\r\\nmoderately. Economists in the steel industry report that auto companies have \\r\\nplaced orders at normal levels for steel deliveries for July, August, and \\r\\nSeptember, despite auto strike possibilities. Auto firms regularly place a \\r\\nnormal level of steel orders before contract negotiations, and this year will \\r\\nask steel firms to take finished steel into inventories if a strike materializes \\r\\nin mid-September. Furthermore, if a strike occurs, production should not decline \\r\\nas much as shipments because inventory building will probably occur at the mills \\r\\nlate in the year. Trade sources report that auto companies are unable to get \\r\\ncommitments for Japanese steel to be delivered next year. Apparently, Japan will \\r\\nnot accept steel orders above the voluntary quotas, and will not divert steel to \\r\\nautomotive companies from regular customers. Steel industry economists in our \\r\\narea report export demand is declining rapidly.], [Striking sheetmetal workers and plumbers in Cleveland settled their disputes at \\r\\nthe end of July and in early August. Only one major unionâ€”pipefittersâ€”remains on \\r\\nstrike, but this is enough to keep construction at a reduced level in the \\r\\nCleveland area. The principal unresolved issue is the hiring of minority \\r\\nworkers. A $3 per hour increase over three years (raising journeyman rates by \\r\\n1972 to $9.41 for painters, $10.20 for iron workers, and $10.81 for sheetmetal \\r\\nworkers, for example) appears to be the pattern of settlement accepted by all of \\r\\nthe other construction crafts in the area. The increases will further widen the \\r\\nlocal-national differential in average hourly earnings for journeymen and \\r\\nhelpers in all construction trades (last year, $5.99 in Cleveland and $4.78 in \\r\\nthe nation).], [Economists and senior investment officers at several of the largest banks in the \\r\\nDistrict were recently surveyed informally regarding their current views and \\r\\nexpectations about the economy, the banking situation, and money market \\r\\nconditions. Almost all of the respondents indicated they expect the economy to \\r\\nremain sluggish during the second half of 1970, although most of the economists \\r\\nlook for a modest increase in real activity. All of the major banks in the \\r\\nDistrict are experiencing strong loan demand and demand is expected to remain \\r\\nbrisk over the foreseeable future. Respondents felt that the present comfortable \\r\\ntone of the money market would continue and that funds would be readily \\r\\navailable to banks at interest rates equal to or slightly below current levels. \\r\\nOne investment officer from a large bank reported that they had just reduced the \\r\\nrate on 60-89 day money to 7 3/4 per cent and would now pay a uniform rate \\r\\nacross the board in the , [], \\r\\n30-89 day maturity range. The same bank anticipates \\r\\nanother reduction in the CD rate in the near future. All of the banks are much \\r\\nmore concerned about the credit worthiness of borrowers than formerly, and \\r\\nexpressed the view that this concern would persist.], [Several of our Cincinnati Branch Directors, at a meeting of the Board last \\r\\nMonday, commented about the continued sluggishness of the economy.

They indicated that business sales are slightly ahead of a \\r\\nyear ago, and inventories of most firms are \"about right.\" Some excess capacity \\r\\nis reported. Capital spending apparently peaked in 1969 and is currently \\r\\ndeclining. Capital spending is expected to increase somewhat in 1971 but to \\r\\nremain below the current-dollar level of 1969. Employment cutbacks are reported \\r\\nby more than half of the responding firms, but wages and salaries are up \\r\\nconsiderably. Hurricane Celia hit the West Gulf Coast of Texas and caused damage \\r\\nestimated in excess of $500 million.], [Most of the corporate executives reported that sales were a little higher so far \\r\\nin 1970 than in the same period a year ago. One electronic firm indicated that \\r\\nsales this year had lagged behind the level of a year ago, and another noted \\r\\nsome softness in their recent orders. One firm in the computer industry reported \\r\\nthat sales so far this year were up from a year ago but weakness is expected in \\r\\nthe months ahead. One firm particularly noted an increase in price consciousness \\r\\namong their customers.], [Although sales have not been particularly strong, most of the firms indicate \\r\\nthat they are about in line with expectations. This would suggest that the \\r\\nbusiness slowdown was correctly anticipated by most. Because the correct sales \\r\\ntrend was anticipated by most firms, current inventory levels are considered \\r\\n\"about right\" by the majority. Three firms did indicate that their inventories \\r\\nwere somewhat too high at the present time.], [More than half of the firms represented in our sample project capital spending \\r\\nfor the year 1970 to be less than in 1969. The dollar value of capital spending \\r\\nby these firms will likely be down about 14 per cent in 1970 from the 1969 \\r\\nlevel. Much of the weakness in capital spending apparently stems from a trimming \\r\\nback of earlier plans. Half of the respondents indicated that the dollar value \\r\\nof their capital appropriations for the second half of 1970 was less than \\r\\nearlier preliminary plans. Not a single firm reported that capital \\r\\nappropriations for the second half of this year would be larger than their \\r\\npreliminary plans. These declining capital spending plans are consistent with \\r\\nthe report of \"a little\" excess capacity at four firms while one reported much \\r\\nexcess capacity. There were no reports of capacity shortage. Some of the decline \\r\\nin capital spending from the high 1969 level is accounted for by electronic and \\r\\ncomputer firms that have been affected by the trimming of the defense budget, as \\r\\nwell as by the overall business slowdown. Another major factor in the capital \\r\\nspending decline is the tapering off of construction by a large national gas \\r\\npipeline company. The lack of new gas supplies has reduced their need to expand \\r\\nthe transmission system. The only real strength in 1970 capital spending comes \\r\\nfrom one electric utility and some oil drilling and refining firms.], [Capital spending for 1971 for this group of firms is now planned to be up \\r\\nslightly from the expected 1970 level but still about 7 per cent below the \\r\\nrealized 1969 level in current dollars. Two-thirds of the firms actually expect \\r\\ncapital outlays to be less in 1971 than in 1970. A substantial increase in \\r\\ncapital spending is projected by a large oil company.], [Every firm responding to this questionnaire reports that employee wages and \\r\\nsalaries are up this year. The most common increase was 6 to 7 per cent while \\r\\nthe range was from 3.5 to 8 per cent. More than half of the firms have cut back \\r\\ntheir employment level this year with the cutbacks ranging from as low as 1 per \\r\\ncent to as high as 25 per cent.

Damage estimates range from $500 million to $1 billion. Banking services were \\r\\nhalted for two days and then reopened on a limited basis. About 3 per cent of \\r\\nthe U.

District manufacturers \\r\\nresponding to our latest industrial expectations survey feel that \\r\\nthe rate of advance in District manufacturing sales will continue \\r\\nsluggish during the remainder of 1970.], [In responding to a question on corporate profits, bank directors and \\r\\nofficers indicated that profits in the Ninth District suffered or at \\r\\nbest held steady during the second quarter, although there were \\r\\nnotable exceptions. In response to this situation numerous examples \\r\\nof cost cutting were cited. An economist for a large national \\r\\nmanufacturer stated that attitudes have changed in his company on \\r\\nwhat constitutes a necessary cost. One large brewery in the Twin \\r\\nCities cut its current advertising budget by $800,000. District \\r\\nemployers have curtailed their utilization of labor through layoffs \\r\\nand overtime reductions, and a large Minneapolis computer \\r\\nmanufacturer instructed each employee to take ten days of unpaid \\r\\nvacation before the end of the year. Cost cutting is also \\r\\nmanifesting itself in reductions in capital spending and inventory \\r\\ncutbacks.], [\\r\\nAlthough reports indicate District businessmen are trying to cut \\r\\ninventories, several cases of unwanted inventory accumulation were \\r\\nreported. One large Twin City manufacturer's inventory increased \\r\\nbecause of overly optimistic sales projections. Reports reveal that \\r\\nthe large retailers and a national mail order house have accumulated \\r\\ninventories because of the trucking strike. They are receiving this \\r\\nsummer' s seasonal merchandise late and are being forced to cut its \\r\\nprice to avoid carrying it over.], [One factor, however, that will impede cost cutting efforts by \\r\\nDistrict businessmen is the recent large wage concessions granted to \\r\\nthe construction workers and Teamsters. As a result of these \\r\\nsettlements, bank directors indicate that unions in their areas are \\r\\nbecoming very aggressive in their wage demands, making the \\r\\nsettlement of some current negotiations difficult. One director \\r\\nreports that construction companies are cutting overtime because of \\r\\nthe large wage settlements.], [\\r\\n                            We serve the public by pursuing a growing economy and stable financial system that work for all of us., [\\n]]]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

A mixture of reports is common, however, within most manufacturing industries important to this District, and the slight improvement is due to fewer reports of further declines rather than to any significant resurgence of orders.], [Recent improvement in retail sales, especially in automobiles, is reported. Reports from West Virginia, however, indicate that business has been seriously affected by the current coal miners' strike. Manufacturers' inventories, while apparently being reduced somewhat, are still reported to be higher than desired.], [\\r\\nThe District employment situation apparently remains weak. While some further employment declines are reported in textiles, chemicals, metals, and electrical equipment, the declines do not appear as widespread as they were two or three months ago. The length of the work week, however, is reportedly still decreasing in manufacturing industries.], [\\r\\nReports of increasing unemployment are common throughout the Fifth District, and available labor supplies are generally regarded as adequate. Respondents in manufacturing as well as trade and services report skilled labor to be in relatively short supply, but they feel that there are adequate numbers of unskilled workers available.], [\\r\\nReports indicate that, on balance, prices continue to rise in the District. Coal, fabricated metal items, and electrical machinery are among the District's manufacturing industries in which prices are reported increasing. Large increases in coal prices are of considerable concern in the region because of implications they have for electric utility rates as well as other services. Few instances of actual declines in list prices are reported, although respondents continue to report evidence of price shading. Continued upward pressure on wages is reported in nonferrous metals and furniture manufacturing.], [Residential construction, which has been severely depressed in the District, is reported somewhat improved in recent weeks. Though still on the down side, some improvement is reported in residential building activity in certain areas of North Carolina, Virginia, and West Virginia, and in the Baltimore area. Nonresidential building, which has fared better in recent months, apparently is continuing to improve throughout the District generally.], [Loan demand of all types at banks in the District apparently has failed to keep pace with last month's reported rise. Demand for business loans is reported essentially unchanged, and consumer loan demand has increased only slightly. Increases in mortgage loan demand were reported to be significant in May and June, but began to taper last month, and were only marginal in the most recent four-week period.], [\\r\\nThe number of respondents reporting that they expect further decline in general economic activity diminished substantially in the most recent survey. Evidence of optimism, however, remains spotty, and apparently no general expectation of an immediate recovery exists yet in the Fifth District.], [Respondents in the District have been far from unanimous in their evaluations of their capital spending plans. While some respondents have indicated reductions, planned capital spending apparently has not been substantially reduced in recent months. The latest survey, however, indicates somewhat more widespread reductions than before, especially in textiles, chemicals, and furniture manufacturing.], [Inventories in manufacturing and in trade and services remain on the high side.

As evidence of these \\r\\nobservations, the directors cited such things as unemployment \\r\\nincreasing in their areas, retail sales becoming sluggish, \\r\\nbusinessmen hesitating to build up inventories, and an almost \\r\\nuniversal observation of slowing in auto sales. In addition, one \\r\\ndirector was aware of a case where a steel company supplying the \\r\\nauto industry has cut back its orders of iron ore pellets. One \\r\\ndirector, on the other hand, observed that lumber and wood products \\r\\nmanufacturers in western Montana have become optimistic in their \\r\\nexpectations of sales during the latter half of this year. These \\r\\nproducers were severely affected by the downturn in housing \\r\\nconstruction, but not expect their sales to increase with the \\r\\nanticipated upturn in housing.], [In spite of the business slowdown, the directors felt that \\r\\ninflationary psychology has not abated in their local areas, but \\r\\nthat recent events in Indochina have not had a discernible separate \\r\\neffect on inflationary psychology. They also felt that people are \\r\\nconcerned not only with the effect of inflation, but also with all \\r\\nother areas of unrest in this country.

As a result, the profits of \\r\\nfarm operations have fallen off.], [Scattered pieces of information suggest that area businessmen may be \\r\\npostponing or at least stretching out their capital expenditures. \\r\\nDuring the first three months of this year, the valuation of \\r\\nbuilding permits issued for nonresidential building in the Ninth \\r\\nDistrict were about 9 percent below the comparable year-earlier \\r\\nperiod.

Two cases were \\r\\ncited at the recent directors meeting, however, which are expected \\r\\nto lead to increasing capital expenditures. In one case, it was \\r\\nstated that a railroad based in the Ninth District would have to \\r\\nexpand its capital expenditures to take advantage of the economies \\r\\nof scale inherent in a recent merger of four lines. In the second \\r\\ncase, a copper producer in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan has \\r\\nundertaken a housing program which, when completed, will double the \\r\\nsize of the town in which the mine is located.

Their \\r\\ncomments, as given below, are separated on the basis of real versus \\r\\nmonetary markets.], [[Monetary Conditions and Capital Markets], [], \\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Otto Eckstein characterized capital markets as currently \\r\\nbeing in a \"most unusual state\", attributing this to (1) the \\r\\nSystem's switch to aggregate targets, (2) the continuing high rate \\r\\nof inflation and suspicion that it will not abate, and (3) \\r\\nuncertainties wrought by Cambodia andâ€”particularlyâ€”the stock \\r\\nmarket. With respect to the Fed's current stance, Eckstein \\r\\nemphatically pointed out that policy can be judged as having been \\r\\neasier over the last few months only by a monetarist's standards. \\r\\nMeasured from any starting month previous to February 1970, the \\r\\nwidely touted 10 percent annual growth rate of money stock shrinks \\r\\nto 3 to 5 percent. On top of this moderate rate of growth, Eckstein \\r\\ninterprets the events of April and May as having led to a greatly \\r\\nincreased liquidity preference on the part of the public, concluding \\r\\nthat endorsement of a 4 percent rate of monetary growth during the \\r\\ncurrent period is \"really somewhat cavalier\".], [Professor James Tobin concurred with Eckstein on this view of System \\r\\npolicy, additionally pointing out that with a 4 or 5 percent rate of \\r\\ngrowth, money supply is shrinking in real terms. Tobin also voiced \\r\\nfears that the Fed's excessively tight policy in combination with \\r\\nits shift to aggregate targets has forced interest rates to a point \\r\\nwell above the real rate of return on capital, a state of affairs he \\r\\nfeels will depress real activity more than we are bargaining for.], [At the opposite end of the spectrum was Professor Henry Wallich, who \\r\\nstated that Fed policy is threatening to become overly easy \"no \\r\\nmatter how money stock is measured\".], [\\r\\nViews varied also on the causes and the implications of the stock \\r\\nmarket decline. Wallich feels the principal explanation is the \\r\\nnecessary, but painful, adjustment of equity markets to a 9 percent \\r\\nbond market. Tobin, on the other hand, feels the decline has been \\r\\nserious, stating that it will have both wealth and cost of capital \\r\\neffects, and that it is symptomatic of a general economic malaise. \\r\\nWhen viewed from the more regional, micro outlook of our banking \\r\\ndirectors, money market conditions appeared more optimistic. Only a \\r\\nmonth ago all three of our Class A directors were reporting \\r\\ncommercial loan demands at an all-time high at their respective \\r\\ninstitutions. Two now report that this situation has moderated to a \\r\\ndegree where their banks can handle it. Our directors also report a \\r\\nhealthy pickup in deposit inflows over the last three weeks in all \\r\\ncategories, but particularly in consumer-type deposits. Mr. Kennedy \\r\\nnoted that for the first time in 1970, deposit figures at his \\r\\ninstitution are now exceeding year-ago levels. Taken together, these \\r\\nfactors represent a substantial shift toward optimism among our \\r\\nbanking directors from a month ago.], [[GNP and Real Market Aggregates], [], \\r\\n\\r\\nOur academicians shifted positions in their discussion of the \\r\\noutlook in real markets, with Eckstein becoming the most bullish. He \\r\\nsees the economy currently hovering between recession and no growth, \\r\\nbut remains convinced that most of the GNP markdown will occur in \\r\\nthe first half of this year. While he hasn't made a run on his model \\r\\nfor about three weeks now, he sees total 1970 GNP falling in the \\r\\n$982-$985 billion range, with unemployment at 5.0 to 5.2 percent by \\r\\nthe year-end. Eckstein further offered the opinion that, if we do \\r\\nhave a recession (however measured), it will be far and away the \\r\\nmildest of the postwar period.], [Wallich similarly sees 1970 nominal GNP winding up in the $980-$985 \\r\\nbillion range, with a nominal fourth-quarter gain of about $15 \\r\\nbillion. While he identified unemployment, prices, and interest \\r\\nrates as all behaving worse than expected, he expressed confidence \\r\\nthat the nominal GNP forecasts made earlier this year will hold up \\r\\nquite well. Noting how successive capital surveys have shown a \\r\\nconsistency, he does not feel that capital expenditure plans are \\r\\ncollapsing, and he sees the possibility of bringing the GNP deflator \\r\\ndown to a level of 4 percent by the year-end. On the outlook for \\r\\nunemployment in the third and fourth quarters, he was somewhat more \\r\\nbearish than Eckstein.], [Tobin once again provided the most gloomy assessment, predicting \\r\\nunemployment will rise to at least 5 1/2 percent by the year-end, \\r\\nand very possibly higher. He did not provide us with GNP projections \\r\\nfor the next two quarters.], [Again turning to the micro-oriented views of our directors, the \\r\\npicture is quite mixed. Mr. Robertson of the Bangor Punta Corp. \\r\\n(aircraft firearms, recreational equipment, farm products, etc.) \\r\\nreports that sales are continuing a sharp deterioration in nearly \\r\\nall their lines, with the one major exception the capital goods \\r\\nproduced in their process engineering division. Their layoffs have \\r\\nbeen substantial, and capital expenditure plans have been cut back \\r\\n30 to 40 percent. Other directors, however, noted that layoffs seem \\r\\nto have subsided in their areas. Messrs. Cabot (Cabot Corp.) and \\r\\nCarter (Nashua Corp.) report their capital expenditure plans are \\r\\ncontinuing at or near the levels originally planned, althoughâ€”apropos of Tobin's point aboveâ€”Mr. Carter did note that their \\r\\ncapital spending is becoming increasingly contingent upon securing \\r\\nreasonably priced financing. Other queries to our directors produced \\r\\nno shift in sentiment from the views they expressed a month ago.], [\\r\\n                            We serve the public by pursuing a growing economy and stable financial system that work for all of us., [\\n]]]</td>\n",

The \\r\\ngeneral opinion is that the economy is experiencing a mild slowdown, \\r\\nand there is no expectation of a complete recovery until the end of \\r\\nthe year. At the same time, there is little optimism that inflation \\r\\nwill be brought under control quickly. Consumer demand continues to \\r\\nbe high, although sales are somewhat slower than last year, and \\r\\nthere is continued demand upon banks for credit. The adverse effects \\r\\nof the slowdown appear in two principal forms. Unemployment is seen \\r\\nto be much higher this year, and many firms report experiencing a \\r\\nprofit squeeze. They say that they are unable to offset by price \\r\\nincreases or greater sales volume their higher costs. In \\r\\nconsequence, they are attempting to cut expenses by reducing staffs, \\r\\ncutting inventories, and delaying capital protects.], [Unemployment has risen in most parts of the District. The highest \\r\\nlevels are in the Pacific Northwest where the principal problems are \\r\\ncentered in the lumber industry and Boeing Aircraft. Boeing is the \\r\\nprincipal employer in the Seattle-Tacoma area, and it has cut its \\r\\nemployment from over 100,000 in 1968 to 58,000 now, with further \\r\\nlayoffs announced for the rest of this year to reduce the level to \\r\\n43,000. Lumber operations have been at a reduced pace throughout \\r\\nmuch of Washington and Oregon. Apparently the smaller mills are \\r\\nbearing the major burden, while the large integrated mills continue \\r\\nto maintain production. There is some expectation of a recovery, at \\r\\nleast in Oregon, toward the end of the year. The other area with a \\r\\nmajor unemployment problem is southern California, where the \\r\\naffected industries are aerospace and, to a less extent, housing.], [Construction of new residential housing and the opening of new \\r\\nsubdivisions continue to be slow. The decline in demand is heaviest \\r\\nin the Seattle area because of the layoffs at Boeing. The principal \\r\\nstrength is in commercial construction. This is certainly the case \\r\\nin California where commercial building remains high. In many cases \\r\\nthere is also a strong demand for mobile homes. This particular \\r\\nchange may be part of a tendency for consumers to downgrade the \\r\\nquality of their housing demand.\\r\\n], [Retail sales remain relatively steady despite the rising \\r\\nunemployment, and they continue to be a source of strength in most \\r\\nareas. For most kinds of consumer goods, there is no sign of \\r\\ndowngrading in choice of items as a means of economizing. Consumers \\r\\nare reported to be more careful in watching for and responding to \\r\\nsales, but there is no pronounced shift to lower grade goods. When \\r\\npurchases of major appliances are made, the demand is still for the \\r\\n\\r\\n  higher-grade line. Replies from major department stores indicate the \\r\\ngeneral composition of their business is not changed, although sales \\r\\nare not rising at last year's pace.], [There is one major exception to this picture. Reports from \\r\\nthroughout the District indicate that consumers are economizing on \\r\\ntheir automobile purchases. They are shifting away from middle-line \\r\\nmodels to lower priced and foreign economy cars, although luxury car \\r\\ndemand remains high. As part of this shift, there appears to be an \\r\\nincreased demand for late model used cars. Therefore, there is \\r\\nevidence of both a reduction of automobile purchases and a \\r\\ndowngrading of quality of purchases.], [The recent decline in the stock market has not had any noticeable \\r\\nimpact on consumer purchases, but it does seem to contribute toward \\r\\ncreating more general uncertainty on the part of businessmen. One \\r\\nspecific example of the effect of lower stock prices reported is \\r\\nthose cases where stock had been used as loan collateral and the \\r\\nborrowers were forced to sell at a loss to cover the loan.], [Many businesses report that their profit margins are being narrowed \\r\\nby higher costs, especially labor costs and by an inability to raise \\r\\ntheir revenue. Sales are not rising to offset the costs, and general \\r\\nprice increases are not always feasible. In consequence, there is \\r\\nmore emphasis upon cost reductions. This takes various forms: closer \\r\\ncontrols over inventories, increased layoffs of employees, and in \\r\\nsome cases postponement of capital projects. In fact, one of the \\r\\nclearest responses of individual businesses to this combination of \\r\\nsmaller profit margins and continued high interest rates appears in \\r\\nthe reduction of capital spending. One large oil company, for \\r\\nexample, describes its projects as being continuously reviewed, and \\r\\nseveral other manufacturing companies report a postponement and \\r\\nreduction of planned expenditures.], [Financial pressures are also an element in the slowing of business \\r\\ncapital expenditures. Several companies reported credit stringency \\r\\nand high interest costs as factors leading to a revision in their \\r\\nplans. In one case, foreign financial conditions caused difficulties \\r\\nfor one company; foreign banks were unable to supply funds normally \\r\\nutilized by this business. Financial conditions continue to be cited \\r\\nas an important adverse factor influencing the construction \\r\\nindustry. This is in spite of deliberate efforts by banks to \\r\\nallocate funds to meet this demand. Banks are continuing to be \\r\\nselected in the kinds of loans that they make.], [In summary, reports of our directors and other businessmen point to \\r\\na slowing of the pace of economic activity and a greater reluctance \\r\\non their part to undertake major expenditures in the near future.], [\\r\\n                            We serve the public by pursuing a growing economy and stable financial system that work for all of us., [\\n]]]</td>\n",

Department \\r\\nstores seemed to be particularly hard hit by the softening of \\r\\ndemand, while discount stores and \"bargain basements\" were holding \\r\\nup well. Weakness was particularly strong in furniture, appliances, \\r\\ntelevision sets, and clothing. Auto buying was an area where \\r\\n\"downgrading\" was especially intenseâ€”except in Dallas. The trend \\r\\nwas heavily to cheaper models, stripped-down models, \"compacts\", \\r\\nlow-priced imports, and late-model used cars.

Third, unemployment in the rural areas \\r\\nof the district is rising, partially because people who had left for \\r\\nhigher paying jobs in Metropolitan areas are now returning after \\r\\nhaving been laid off.], [The softer labor market conditions have resulted in fewer summer job \\r\\nopportunities for students this year than in the past few years. The \\r\\ntwo reasons that were most often cited for this lack of job \\r\\nopportunities were that construction and tourism, the two major \\r\\nactivities in the district where students usually find work, are \\r\\noperating at lower levels than in the past few years; and a number \\r\\nof employers who are facing squeezes on profits and liquidity are \\r\\nnot hiring summer help as freely as they did in previous summers.], [A number of additional cases which indicate that consumers are \\r\\ndowngrading the quality of their purchases have come to our \\r\\nattention in the past month. Directors from areas in the district \\r\\nwhere tourism is a major industry all report that tourist spending \\r\\nis down significantly from a year ago. At the same time, however, \\r\\ntraffic seems to be about the same as it was last year. Instead of \\r\\nspending money and attending paying attractions, people are relying \\r\\nmore on free accommodations and are traveling with campers rather \\r\\nthan staying in motels. Meanwhile, repair shops for automobiles and \\r\\nother durable goods are reporting record volumes of business; a \\r\\nregional parts distribution center for a major automobile \\r\\nmanufacturer in the twin cities reports that the demand for \\r\\nautomobile parts is so great that its crews are working overtime. \\r\\nAlthough automobile sales in the district are still at depressed \\r\\nlevels, the weakness seems to be centered on the more expensive \\r\\nmodels while the market for lighter, economy models and used autos \\r\\nappears to be relatively strong.], [The greatest evidence of \"price shading\" in the district is at the \\r\\nretail level. In addition to markdowns on automobiles, the directors \\r\\nfelt that retailers were holding sales earlier than usual this \\r\\nsummer and were offering larger discounts. One reason given for this \\r\\nwas that inventories appear to be larger than desired because of the \\r\\ngeneral slowing in retail sales. Retailers are also concerned that \\r\\nthey will \"get stuck\" with merchandise that was ordered before the \\r\\ntruckers' strike and is only now arriving.], [There appears to be very little \"price shading\" for industrial \\r\\ngoods, and directors and officers of the bank cited a number of \\r\\ncases where prices have actually risen in the past few weeks. In \\r\\ngeneral the feeling was that manufacturers do not have adequate \\r\\nmargins with which to cut prices. As one director put it, \"business \\r\\nis hurting but volume at a loss doesn't help.\" Another felt that \\r\\nindustrial suppliers are beginning to drop unprofitable lines. On \\r\\nthe other hand one director indicated that discounts in some \\r\\nconstruction materials are greater now than they were a year ago. He \\r\\nwas careful to point out, however, that list prices have risen \\r\\nduring the past year, and as a result, the net effect on prices is \\r\\nnot clear. He noted that sales efforts among construction materials \\r\\ndistributors have intensified, and that they have improved services \\r\\nincluding schedules in order to increase their sales.], [The slowing in sales along with a decreased availability of funds \\r\\nhas led to an increase in district business failures. The three most \\r\\ncommon characteristics of failing businesses are that they were \\r\\nrelatively young firms, were in industries in which entry is fairly \\r\\neasy, and/or were undercapitalized. Of the 21 failures of which one \\r\\nleading district banker was aware, all could be attributed to one or \\r\\nmore of these factors. One director observed that the number of \\r\\nfailures or near failures in the construction industry has risen in \\r\\nrecent months. The primary cause for this is the lack of working \\r\\ncapital, a problem which is chronic in the industry, but which has \\r\\nbecome increasingly acute because of the large number of recent \\r\\nstrikes and the slowing in construction activity.], [\\r\\n                            We serve the public by pursuing a growing economy and stable financial system that work for all of us., [\\n]]]</td>\n",

The head of a large \\r\\nchain observed, however, that retail stores need an increase of \\r\\nthree to three and one half percent in volume to bring profit up to \\r\\nlast year's level.

The chairman of a large manufacturing firm \\r\\nobserved that inventories were high mainly because business \"is not \\r\\nselling goods as fast as desired,\" although special factors such as \\r\\nthe recent truckers' strike in Chicago had contributed to the \\r\\nbuildup, as had \"a new permanent inflation factor\" that has been \\r\\nbuilt into inventories.], [Most directors seemed to believe the current strains in the \\r\\nfinancial markets did not pose a serious threat to business activity \\r\\nat the present time, although the head of a large New York City bank \\r\\ndeclared he thought there would be \"adverse\" effects, but was unable \\r\\nto judge whether these would be \"serious.\" Despite the near-consensus that there was no immediate threat, a number of directors \\r\\nand other business executives did indicate concern regarding \\r\\nfinancial developments. A banker from upstate New York noted that \\r\\nmany businessmen who have long-term financings in the offing are \\r\\nattempting to arrange standby intermediate or short-term credits as \\r\\npossible alternative solutions to their financing needs. An \\r\\ninvestment banker commented that his firm had been marketing four-to-five year securities for many clients, and that if inflation is \\r\\nnot halted, he sees \"an end to public financing of debt issues.\" A \\r\\nlarge retailer observed that small manufacturers were in serious \\r\\nshape with regard to liquidity; they cannot borrow as easily as very \\r\\nbig concerns, and at the same time big retailers are slower in \\r\\nmaking payments to them than in the past, inasmuch as the discount \\r\\nfor prompt payment is less than the cost of borrowing money. \\r\\nCustomer payments to retail stores were also noted as slower than \\r\\nusual, The head of a New York academic institution declared the long \\r\\ndecline in the stock market had cut gifts to private educational \\r\\ninstitutions and had drastically reduced the market value of \\r\\nholdings of endowed institutions.

The dollar value of capital spending \\r\\nby these firms will likely be down about 14 per cent in 1970 from the 1969 \\r\\nlevel. Much of the weakness in capital spending apparently stems from a trimming \\r\\nback of earlier plans. Half of the respondents indicated that the dollar value \\r\\nof their capital appropriations for the second half of 1970 was less than \\r\\nearlier preliminary plans. Not a single firm reported that capital \\r\\nappropriations for the second half of this year would be larger than their \\r\\npreliminary plans.

There were no reports of capacity shortage. Some of the decline \\r\\nin capital spending from the high 1969 level is accounted for by electronic and \\r\\ncomputer firms that have been affected by the trimming of the defense budget, as \\r\\nwell as by the overall business slowdown. Another major factor in the capital \\r\\nspending decline is the tapering off of construction by a large national gas \\r\\npipeline company.

They do not, however, expect a \\r\\nvigorous recovery, and one economist described the current slowdown \\r\\nand expected recovery as being saucer shaped. He said that the \\r\\ncurrent slowdown has not been as rapid or deep as in earlier post-World War II downturns and that the recovery will not be as sharp as \\r\\nin previous upturns.

A major Minneapolis scientific instrument and \\r\\nordnance manufacturer, for example, reduced its original increase in \\r\\ncapital spending plans by 20 per cent.

An \\r\\nincreasing amount of skepticism with regard to business recovery \\r\\nforecasts for later this year stands in sharp contrast with an \\r\\nearlier more optimistic attitude. More comments of \"belt-tightening\" \\r\\nare noted as an increasing number of firms plan a reduction in their \\r\\nwork force, mostly through attrition, although a few are laying off \\r\\nsome employees. The financial agencies report some easing in credit \\r\\ndemands relative to supply, but no major declines have been noted in \\r\\nrates charged to borrowers.], [A few months ago most of the officials interviewed were looking \\r\\n\"across the valley\" to the time when a resumption of the uptrend of \\r\\nrecent years was anticipated. Since there is little indication that \\r\\nthe uptrend will soon be resumed, businessmen appear to have become \\r\\nresigned to a substantially slower rate of expansion. One major \\r\\nexception to the downtrend is commercial banking, where deposits and \\r\\nearnings are reported up, with promising future prospects.], [Sales at all levels have been disappointing in recent weeks. \\r\\nDepartment store sales have been well below expectations since late \\r\\nJuly. A number of manufacturers, including shoe and box companies, \\r\\nlikewise report a low sales level compared to other recent years. Of \\r\\nthose interviewed, only the beer company officials reported sales \\r\\nconforming to trend patterns. Great concern for inflationary \\r\\ntendencies continues. Especially worrisome in the face of a business \\r\\nslowdown and declining profits are the rising wage costs. With the \\r\\ndecline of expectations of an early upturn and no relief in sight \\r\\nfrom the current profit squeeze, business has now begun a number of \\r\\nbelt-tightening operations. Retail stores report a closer scrutiny \\r\\nof inventories than heretofore. Most firms are either holding \\r\\nconstant or are gradually reducing their work forces. The reduction \\r\\nis primarily by attrition, although a few firms reported some \\r\\nlayoffs in recent weeks. The major manufacturing industries still \\r\\nindicate no reduction in long-run expansion plans; however, some \\r\\npostponement in security sales for financing expansion plans has \\r\\nbeen noted.], [The real estate financing agencies report that funds for financing \\r\\nhome building and purchases are somewhat more plentiful. They add, \\r\\nhowever, that this is not the result of larger inflows of savings, \\r\\nbut instead reflects the slowdown in demand for such credit. \\r\\nBuilders report little demand for large homes.], [Although the prospects for business expansion and new plant \\r\\nconstruction have declined in St. Louis and other large Eighth \\r\\nDistrict centers, expansion continues at a healthy pace in the \\r\\noutlying areas, especially in the southern portion of the District \\r\\nwhere earnings of smaller companies continue at satisfactory levels.], [The outlook for agriculture is mixed. Cattle feeders in the Eighth \\r\\nDistrict are making little or no profit. Hogs have been profitable \\r\\nduring the past year, but the prospects for the rest of this year \\r\\nand early next year are less promising. Although broilers are \\r\\nunprofitable at the moment, the situation can change rather rapidly \\r\\nfor broiler producers. Egg and milk producers are doing quite well. \\r\\nCrops are very late and much land was not planted, but with a late \\r\\nfrost a high level of crop production is still possible.], [Prices of meat and other livestock products are likely to average \\r\\nsomewhat lower in the year ahead than in the past twelve months, \\r\\npointing to somewhat less upward pressure on food prices.], [\\r\\n                            We serve the public by pursuing a growing economy and stable financial system that work for all of us., [\\n]]]</td>\n",

Widespread campus disturbances in \\r\\nthe District have forced a number of universities to close and \\r\\nundoubtedly have had an adverse impact on business conditions in \\r\\nlocal areas. This Bank's regular monthly survey of about 70 large \\r\\nmanufacturing companies in the District reflected the softening in \\r\\nnationwide industrial activity last fall and early winter. Signs of \\r\\na bottoming were evidenced in the survey taken in April, but the May \\r\\nsurvey revealed sharp setbacks during the month of April in key \\r\\nseries such as new orders and shipments and a marked deterioration \\r\\nin employment and the workweek, presumably because of work \\r\\nstoppages. The District's insured unemployment rate, which had been \\r\\nedging moderately upward (from 1 percent last October to 2 percent \\r\\nin late March), jumped one percentage point during April to 3 \\r\\npercent.], [At a meeting of about 40 business economists, held at the Bank on \\r\\nMay 15, there were mixed reports concerning recent price behavior. \\r\\nThe majority maintained that wage-cost pressures, in the face of \\r\\nslack demand, are so great as to make it easy to \"pass on\" higher \\r\\nprices. Some economists, however, reported \"under the table\" \\r\\ndiscounting and price rebates, which presumably are not being \\r\\nrecorded in the official price indexes. Specifically, an economist \\r\\nfrom a major rubber company said his firm's price index for tires, \\r\\nbased on actual transactions prices and reflecting the mix of \\r\\nconsumer purchases, had risen during the past year only about , [], \\r\\none-third as much as the BLS price index for tires. Economists from the \\r\\nchemical industries reported recent weakness in chemical prices and \\r\\nnoted that few chemical products were selling at list prices.], [Other points of interest emerging from the meeting included a report \\r\\nby an economist from a large machine tool company in Cleveland that \\r\\nhis firm was living off backlogs, that business booked in April was \\r\\nonly one-quarter of what they would normally receive at this time of \\r\\nthe year, and that they had not yet booked a single new order in \\r\\nMay. Economists from two major auto companies believed the worst of \\r\\nthe cutback in new car sales and production was over and that, \\r\\nfollowing leveling tendencies in the second and third quarters, \\r\\nsales would recover later in the year. Economists from the steel \\r\\nindustry expect the current favorable trade balance in steel to \\r\\ndeteriorate later in the year, with a strong increase in imports and \\r\\nan easing in exports. On the other hand, the steel industry should \\r\\nsoon begin to feel the effects of hedge buying in anticipation of a \\r\\npossible strike next year.], [Among the comments received from this Bank's directors at a joint \\r\\nboard meeting held on May 14, there were reports that markets for \\r\\nauto components and consumer electronics are becoming softer. One \\r\\ndirector said that one industry in which his firm is a major factor, \\r\\nflat glass, isâ€”and would remainâ€”in the doldrums until auto \\r\\nproduction and construction show improvement, but he was not \\r\\noptimistic. Several directors emphasized that the demand for coal is \\r\\nthe greatest since World War II; stockpiles are low and there is \\r\\ndifficulty in receiving supplies.

One director, \\r\\nthe dean of a graduate school, reported that this year's graduates \\r\\nare harder to place.

A recession is \\r\\nconsidered possible by a number of the board members, but this \\r\\nprospect is causing less concern than inflation since there is a \\r\\nwidespread belief among the directors that a recession would be \\r\\nshort and mild. A liquidity crisis is mentioned as a possibility by \\r\\nonly one-third of the respondents, and the odds attached to this \\r\\noutcome are relatively low. With this overall economic outlook, the \\r\\nboard members expected sales to show no increase or only a small \\r\\nincrease in 1970, while profits are expected to decline. One \\r\\ndirector thought there might be a fall of more than 5 percent in \\r\\nboth sales and profits.], [Every board member reported that employee wages in their firms were \\r\\nbeing increased in 1970. This direct experience with higher wage \\r\\ncosts may be one reason for the almost unanimous concern with \\r\\ninflation, ahead of other economic problems. The smallest wage \\r\\nincrease (4 percent) was cited by an academic leader, while the \\r\\nlargest (10 percent) was mentioned by a banker. The nonbanking \\r\\nbusinessmen mentioned 6 percent most often as the wage adjustment \\r\\nthey were making this year.], [The respondents were unanimous in their view that the Federal budget \\r\\nwould operate with a deficit this year. Apparently, the \\r\\nAdministration's forecast of a budget surplus is not accepted within \\r\\nthe business and financial community, although a few directors \\r\\nthought the deficit might be small.], [Despite some concern about a mild recession, acknowledgment of \\r\\nhigher labor costs, and a generally poor outlook for profits this \\r\\nyear, there were no reports of employment cutbacks by the bankers \\r\\nand businessmen interviewed and no indication that employment cuts \\r\\nwere currently being considered. In fact, plans for very modest \\r\\nexpansion of the labor force were noted by a couple of respondents. \\r\\nThis reported maintenance of employment levels is consistent with \\r\\nthe aggregate data for the Eleventh District, which show total \\r\\nemployment still edging upward. The increase in employment, however, \\r\\nhas not been sufficient to absorb all of the new labor force \\r\\nentrants in the District states. Thus, there has been an increase in \\r\\nunemployment in the Eleventh District since the end of 1969, and \\r\\nunemployment insurance activity is at a considerably higher level.], [The respondents to our survey did note some softening in planned \\r\\nplant and equipment spending. More than half indicated that their \\r\\nJanuary expectations had been revised downward; the estimates of the \\r\\nmagnitude of the downward revision were vague but apparently \\r\\nindicated, in most cases, trimming around the edges rather than \\r\\nwholesale slashing.

Construction contract activity in the District showed \\r\\nrenewed strength in the first quarter of 1970, compared with either \\r\\nthe year-earlier period or the fourth quarter of 1969. Nonbuilding \\r\\nconstruction contracts were up considerably, buoyed by two very \\r\\nlarge contracts; nonresidential contracts also showed a sizable \\r\\nincrease. A seasonal expansion in construction employment has \\r\\noccurred this spring, although the gain came earlier and was \\r\\nsomewhat less than usual.], [Department store sales in the Eleventh District through early May \\r\\nwere up moderately in dollar value, but less than the amount \\r\\nrequired to offset inflation. Sales in early May appeared somewhat \\r\\nstronger than has been the case for the year as a whole so far.], [Agricultural activities throughout most of the Eleventh District are \\r\\nprogressing under generally favorable weather conditions. Cash \\r\\nreceipts from farm marketings in the District states were up \\r\\nsubstantially in the first two months of 1970, compared with year-earlier levels.], [Loan demand in the Eleventh District remained sluggish in April, as \\r\\ntotal loans at weekly reporting commercial banks declined \\r\\ncontraseasonally. With both time and savings deposits increasing, \\r\\nDistrict banks added considerably to their holdings of securities, \\r\\nparticularly municipals.

Perhaps the most pervasive comments revolve about \\r\\nconstruction industry wage settlements. The extremely high national \\r\\nrate of wage increase is mirrored in the District, but of more \\r\\nsignificance, current and emerging wage demands will probably give a \\r\\nnew lift to the national spiral. Construction is at a standstill in \\r\\nsome areas of the District, as new wage bargaining proceeds. \\r\\nExcessive increases in construction costs are an important part of \\r\\nthe reason for the reduced volume of new construction awards, which \\r\\nwill show up in reduced construction activity six months or so \\r\\nhence. Even now, it is reported, there is a virtual absence of small \\r\\nconstruction projects of $750,000 or less.], [The magnitude of wage increases in construction, and in other \\r\\nindustries as well, is causing many to doubt the validity of \\r\\nattempting to bring wage-cost inflation under control by monetary \\r\\nand fiscal policies. There is a strong belief that stabilization \\r\\ngoals can be accomplished only if the unbridled power of labor \\r\\nunions is curbed. In this connection, it was noted that some local \\r\\nmemberships in their push for large gains have effectively \\r\\noverthrown the guidance of national leaders. It was interesting, \\r\\ntoo, to hear that the top construction company in the United States \\r\\nlast year is a nonunion firm.], [Retail sales are reported in the range of from firm to down by \\r\\nvarying amounts. Where sales were reported weak, it was indicated \\r\\nthat the public is deeply concerned about the prospect of recession.], [Despite excellent production prospects, producers of farm crops are \\r\\ndiscouraged by low prices for many of these crops. Bankers in the \\r\\nHigh Plains report that increasing numbers of farmers, particularly \\r\\nwheat farmers, are quitting because of low prices and restricted \\r\\naverage allotment programs. The attrition appears to be \\r\\nsubstantially higher than the average for other recent years caused \\r\\nby the changing structure of the industry. The livestock sector \\r\\ncontinues to remain relatively favorable. However, the impact of \\r\\nhigher livestock prices is expected to be offset by increasing \\r\\ncosts, resulting in little change in net farm income measured in \\r\\ncurrent dollars. Consequently, net farm income measured in real \\r\\nterms is likely to be down.], [The 8-percent increase in net farm income in 1969, combined with \\r\\nefforts of farm producers to increase efficiency by going to larger \\r\\nequipment and other technological improvements, has caused purchases \\r\\nby farmers to increase. Farm machinery dealers report sales of farm \\r\\nequipment to be unusually good. They are fearful, however, that to a \\r\\nconsiderable extent current sales are being made at the expense of \\r\\nnormal future sales. Conversation with farm purchasers indicates \\r\\nthat they are buying now because they expect equipment prices to \\r\\nrise substantially as new union contracts are negotiated.

The other industrialist expected no further declines in \\r\\nthe volume of business. He indicated, though, that he was less \\r\\ncertain about the economy and more confused now than at anytime in \\r\\nhis experience. Further, this industrialist is skeptical about the \\r\\nability of current policy to make much headway against inflation.], [All board members expressed concern over declines in the stock \\r\\nmarket.

The\\r\\nwage-push \\r\\nproblem is particularly acute in the construction industries.

Their \\r\\ncomments, as given below, are separated on the basis of real versus \\r\\nmonetary markets.], [[Monetary Conditions and Capital Markets], [], \\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Otto Eckstein characterized capital markets as currently \\r\\nbeing in a \"most unusual state\", attributing this to (1) the \\r\\nSystem's switch to aggregate targets, (2) the continuing high rate \\r\\nof inflation and suspicion that it will not abate, and (3) \\r\\nuncertainties wrought by Cambodia andâ€”particularlyâ€”the stock \\r\\nmarket. With respect to the Fed's current stance, Eckstein \\r\\nemphatically pointed out that policy can be judged as having been \\r\\neasier over the last few months only by a monetarist's standards. \\r\\nMeasured from any starting month previous to February 1970, the \\r\\nwidely touted 10 percent annual growth rate of money stock shrinks \\r\\nto 3 to 5 percent. On top of this moderate rate of growth, Eckstein \\r\\ninterprets the events of April and May as having led to a greatly \\r\\nincreased liquidity preference on the part of the public, concluding \\r\\nthat endorsement of a 4 percent rate of monetary growth during the \\r\\ncurrent period is \"really somewhat cavalier\".], [Professor James Tobin concurred with Eckstein on this view of System \\r\\npolicy, additionally pointing out that with a 4 or 5 percent rate of \\r\\ngrowth, money supply is shrinking in real terms. Tobin also voiced \\r\\nfears that the Fed's excessively tight policy in combination with \\r\\nits shift to aggregate targets has forced interest rates to a point \\r\\nwell above the real rate of return on capital, a state of affairs he \\r\\nfeels will depress real activity more than we are bargaining for.], [At the opposite end of the spectrum was Professor Henry Wallich, who \\r\\nstated that Fed policy is threatening to become overly easy \"no \\r\\nmatter how money stock is measured\".], [\\r\\nViews varied also on the causes and the implications of the stock \\r\\nmarket decline. Wallich feels the principal explanation is the \\r\\nnecessary, but painful, adjustment of equity markets to a 9 percent \\r\\nbond market. Tobin, on the other hand, feels the decline has been \\r\\nserious, stating that it will have both wealth and cost of capital \\r\\neffects, and that it is symptomatic of a general economic malaise. \\r\\nWhen viewed from the more regional, micro outlook of our banking \\r\\ndirectors, money market conditions appeared more optimistic. Only a \\r\\nmonth ago all three of our Class A directors were reporting \\r\\ncommercial loan demands at an all-time high at their respective \\r\\ninstitutions. Two now report that this situation has moderated to a \\r\\ndegree where their banks can handle it. Our directors also report a \\r\\nhealthy pickup in deposit inflows over the last three weeks in all \\r\\ncategories, but particularly in consumer-type deposits. Mr. Kennedy \\r\\nnoted that for the first time in 1970, deposit figures at his \\r\\ninstitution are now exceeding year-ago levels. Taken together, these \\r\\nfactors represent a substantial shift toward optimism among our \\r\\nbanking directors from a month ago.], [[GNP and Real Market Aggregates], [], \\r\\n\\r\\nOur academicians shifted positions in their discussion of the \\r\\noutlook in real markets, with Eckstein becoming the most bullish. He \\r\\nsees the economy currently hovering between recession and no growth, \\r\\nbut remains convinced that most of the GNP markdown will occur in \\r\\nthe first half of this year. While he hasn't made a run on his model \\r\\nfor about three weeks now, he sees total 1970 GNP falling in the \\r\\n$982-$985 billion range, with unemployment at 5.0 to 5.2 percent by \\r\\nthe year-end. Eckstein further offered the opinion that, if we do \\r\\nhave a recession (however measured), it will be far and away the \\r\\nmildest of the postwar period.], [Wallich similarly sees 1970 nominal GNP winding up in the $980-$985 \\r\\nbillion range, with a nominal fourth-quarter gain of about $15 \\r\\nbillion. While he identified unemployment, prices, and interest \\r\\nrates as all behaving worse than expected, he expressed confidence \\r\\nthat the nominal GNP forecasts made earlier this year will hold up \\r\\nquite well. Noting how successive capital surveys have shown a \\r\\nconsistency, he does not feel that capital expenditure plans are \\r\\ncollapsing, and he sees the possibility of bringing the GNP deflator \\r\\ndown to a level of 4 percent by the year-end. On the outlook for \\r\\nunemployment in the third and fourth quarters, he was somewhat more \\r\\nbearish than Eckstein.], [Tobin once again provided the most gloomy assessment, predicting \\r\\nunemployment will rise to at least 5 1/2 percent by the year-end, \\r\\nand very possibly higher. He did not provide us with GNP projections \\r\\nfor the next two quarters.], [Again turning to the micro-oriented views of our directors, the \\r\\npicture is quite mixed. Mr. Robertson of the Bangor Punta Corp. \\r\\n(aircraft firearms, recreational equipment, farm products, etc.) \\r\\nreports that sales are continuing a sharp deterioration in nearly \\r\\nall their lines, with the one major exception the capital goods \\r\\nproduced in their process engineering division. Their layoffs have \\r\\nbeen substantial, and capital expenditure plans have been cut back \\r\\n30 to 40 percent.

District investment firms are \\r\\nencountering financial difficulties and, as a result, have had to \\r\\nalter their operations.

As a result, the directors \\r\\nfelt that guidelines would probably be publicly unpopular but in \\r\\nmany cases would be privately welcomed. In general, they thought \\r\\nthat people would prefer to see voluntary controls imposed rather \\r\\nthan new legislation, and that businessmen are more in favor of \\r\\nguidelines than labor leaders. The directors cited a number of\\r\\ninstances where business leaders have voiced approval of some kind \\r\\nof guidelines. The directors also cited cases where labor leaders \\r\\ndid not want to be quoted but were concerned with the large \\r\\nsettlements which have been won by unions in recent labor disputes. \\r\\nBecause of these large settlements, rank and file members are \\r\\nexpecting large wage increases and union leaders are afraid to ask \\r\\nfor less.

A telephone poll of two leading local investment banking \\r\\nfirms explored the implications of these problems in three areas of \\r\\ntheir operations. First, operating staffs of securities brokers have \\r\\nbeen cut back about 15 to 20 percent in the last year. These \\r\\ncutbacks, however, were attributed to the decline in volume of \\r\\ntrading rather than to the current financial crisis. In general, \\r\\nsales staffs have been reduced, with the declines occurring in some \\r\\ninstances through attrition rather than through layoffs. Second, a \\r\\nsecurities brokerage house is closing one of its suburban offices \\r\\nbecause of the lack of volume. In addition, a director was aware of \\r\\na mutual fund in Billings, Montana, which has recently closed down. \\r\\nThird, merger activity among securities brokers appears to be on the \\r\\nupswing. Both investment bankers who were contacted reported that \\r\\nthey had been approached by a number of smaller firms in the last \\r\\nthree months. Although only two mergers have been consummated, these \\r\\nfirms felt that additional mergers could take place in the not-too-distant future.], [Scattered pieces of information continue to show that District \\r\\nmanufacturers are cutting back their capital expenditure plans. Two \\r\\ndirectors cited cases where distributors of heavy equipment to \\r\\nagriculture and construction firms have experienced sharp declines \\r\\nin sales during the past month or so. It was also reported that a \\r\\nlarge retail firm headquartered in the twin cities has cut back its \\r\\ncapital appropriations by about 50 percent. One other director \\r\\nstated that General Motors has scheduled huge cutbacks in capital \\r\\nspending, with each division being asked to curtail capital \\r\\nexpenditures.], [A number of examples have come to light which suggest that consumers \\r\\nare changing their consumption patterns. A Minneapolis-based \\r\\nundergarment manufacturer reports that its sales are 10 to 15 \\r\\npercent below last year's levels. They attribute their poor sales \\r\\nperformance this year to the slowdown in department store sales and \\r\\nfeel that consumers are taking their business to lower priced \\r\\nstores.

In addition, repair shops for both automobiles and other \\r\\ndurable goods are experiencing sharp increases in business, which \\r\\nsuggest that consumers are tending to hold off on major durables \\r\\npurchases.

The \\r\\ngeneral opinion is that the economy is experiencing a mild slowdown, \\r\\nand there is no expectation of a complete recovery until the end of \\r\\nthe year. At the same time, there is little optimism that inflation \\r\\nwill be brought under control quickly. Consumer demand continues to \\r\\nbe high, although sales are somewhat slower than last year, and \\r\\nthere is continued demand upon banks for credit. The adverse effects \\r\\nof the slowdown appear in two principal forms. Unemployment is seen \\r\\nto be much higher this year, and many firms report experiencing a \\r\\nprofit squeeze. They say that they are unable to offset by price \\r\\nincreases or greater sales volume their higher costs. In \\r\\nconsequence, they are attempting to cut expenses by reducing staffs, \\r\\ncutting inventories, and delaying capital protects.], [Unemployment has risen in most parts of the District. The highest \\r\\nlevels are in the Pacific Northwest where the principal problems are \\r\\ncentered in the lumber industry and Boeing Aircraft. Boeing is the \\r\\nprincipal employer in the Seattle-Tacoma area, and it has cut its \\r\\nemployment from over 100,000 in 1968 to 58,000 now, with further \\r\\nlayoffs announced for the rest of this year to reduce the level to \\r\\n43,000. Lumber operations have been at a reduced pace throughout \\r\\nmuch of Washington and Oregon. Apparently the smaller mills are \\r\\nbearing the major burden, while the large integrated mills continue \\r\\nto maintain production. There is some expectation of a recovery, at \\r\\nleast in Oregon, toward the end of the year. The other area with a \\r\\nmajor unemployment problem is southern California, where the \\r\\naffected industries are aerospace and, to a less extent, housing.], [Construction of new residential housing and the opening of new \\r\\nsubdivisions continue to be slow. The decline in demand is heaviest \\r\\nin the Seattle area because of the layoffs at Boeing. The principal \\r\\nstrength is in commercial construction. This is certainly the case \\r\\nin California where commercial building remains high. In many cases \\r\\nthere is also a strong demand for mobile homes. This particular \\r\\nchange may be part of a tendency for consumers to downgrade the \\r\\nquality of their housing demand.\\r\\n], [Retail sales remain relatively steady despite the rising \\r\\nunemployment, and they continue to be a source of strength in most \\r\\nareas. For most kinds of consumer goods, there is no sign of \\r\\ndowngrading in choice of items as a means of economizing. Consumers \\r\\nare reported to be more careful in watching for and responding to \\r\\nsales, but there is no pronounced shift to lower grade goods. When \\r\\npurchases of major appliances are made, the demand is still for the \\r\\n\\r\\n  higher-grade line. Replies from major department stores indicate the \\r\\ngeneral composition of their business is not changed, although sales \\r\\nare not rising at last year's pace.], [There is one major exception to this picture. Reports from \\r\\nthroughout the District indicate that consumers are economizing on \\r\\ntheir automobile purchases. They are shifting away from middle-line \\r\\nmodels to lower priced and foreign economy cars, although luxury car \\r\\ndemand remains high. As part of this shift, there appears to be an \\r\\nincreased demand for late model used cars. Therefore, there is \\r\\nevidence of both a reduction of automobile purchases and a \\r\\ndowngrading of quality of purchases.], [The recent decline in the stock market has not had any noticeable \\r\\nimpact on consumer purchases, but it does seem to contribute toward \\r\\ncreating more general uncertainty on the part of businessmen. One \\r\\nspecific example of the effect of lower stock prices reported is \\r\\nthose cases where stock had been used as loan collateral and the \\r\\nborrowers were forced to sell at a loss to cover the loan.], [Many businesses report that their profit margins are being narrowed \\r\\nby higher costs, especially labor costs and by an inability to raise \\r\\ntheir revenue. Sales are not rising to offset the costs, and general \\r\\nprice increases are not always feasible. In consequence, there is \\r\\nmore emphasis upon cost reductions. This takes various forms: closer \\r\\ncontrols over inventories, increased layoffs of employees, and in \\r\\nsome cases postponement of capital projects. In fact, one of the \\r\\nclearest responses of individual businesses to this combination of \\r\\nsmaller profit margins and continued high interest rates appears in \\r\\nthe reduction of capital spending. One large oil company, for \\r\\nexample, describes its projects as being continuously reviewed, and \\r\\nseveral other manufacturing companies report a postponement and \\r\\nreduction of planned expenditures.], [Financial pressures are also an element in the slowing of business \\r\\ncapital expenditures. Several companies reported credit stringency \\r\\nand high interest costs as factors leading to a revision in their \\r\\nplans. In one case, foreign financial conditions caused difficulties \\r\\nfor one company; foreign banks were unable to supply funds normally \\r\\nutilized by this business. Financial conditions continue to be cited \\r\\nas an important adverse factor influencing the construction \\r\\nindustry. This is in spite of deliberate efforts by banks to \\r\\nallocate funds to meet this demand.

These range, however, from the \\r\\nbelief that the bottom will come in the third or fourth quarter of \\r\\nthis year, to the belief of the directors of the Cleveland Federal \\r\\nReserve Bank that the contraction will be \"more prolonged and deeper \\r\\nthan most economists and public policy makers are currently \\r\\nexpecting\".], [A growth in unemployment is noticeable throughout the country, in \\r\\nsome Districts only mildly, but in others strongly. Until recently, \\r\\nmany firms were reducing their work forces simply by letting \\r\\n\"attrition\" take its toll, but now firms are \"furloughing\" workers, \\r\\n\"cutting back\" their staffs, and \"pushing\" early retirements. In a. \\r\\nfew Districts, even \"quality\" labor has begun to be available.

A \\r\\ndefinite easing appears to have developed in the commercial banking \\r\\nsector, while our contacts in both the academic and manufacturing \\r\\nspheres now seem more convinced that the economic slowdown is \\r\\nbottoming out. In line with this general outlook, we were able to \\r\\nfind no reports of price shading at any level of business activity.], [All of our banking directors report that commercial loan demand has \\r\\ndeclined considerably since the historic highs of late spring, and \\r\\nthey characterize deposits in all categories as holding at good to \\r\\nexcellent levels. One banker director reports moderate success in \\r\\nthe large CD area following the relief given in June.

This is \\r\\napparently explained by the continuing production capacity problems \\r\\nreported by several of our respondents in manufacturing, and their \\r\\nexpectations for even heavier demands over 1971. Relative to the \\r\\nearnings picture in New England manufacturing, our contacts \\r\\nuniformly report rather poor or no success in passing along their \\r\\ncost increases. With lower internal flows and continued stringency \\r\\nin external financing arrangements, these firms are scrambling hard \\r\\nto maintain plant and equipment investment at the desired high \\r\\nlevels.], [Reports on retail activity in the region are rather more mixed, with \\r\\nsome areas reporting satisfactory volume and others reporting very \\r\\nslow sales. The impression emerges, however, that in almost all \\r\\nareas, retail sales of consumer durables have been hit hardest by \\r\\nthe slowdown.], [Professor Henry Wallich still expects a nominal GNP for the year of \\r\\n$980-983 billion, the same figure he mentioned earlier in the \\r\\nsummer. He expects declining interest rates to combine with a \\r\\nslowing of the rate of inflation to produce a substantial increase \\r\\nin the quantity of money demanded. Thus, he concludes the system \\r\\nshould reasonably pursue a 6 percent rate of money stock growth over \\r\\nthe rest of 1970. Professor Otto Eckstein concurs in this outlook \\r\\nfor GNP, now forecasting $982 billion for the year. He feels that \\r\\nrecent developments have largely offset each other in terms of \\r\\noverall economic impact. On the negative side, he attaches \\r\\nimportance to the decline in construction contracts and the sharp \\r\\ndrop in prime defense contracts. He further expects manufacturing \\r\\ninvestment to be well under current levels next year. On the plus \\r\\nside, however, are the final cessation of the truck strike, the \\r\\nturnaround in auto sales, and the largest jump in history in utility \\r\\nappropriations.], [The one major difference between Wallich and Eckstein seems to be \\r\\ntheir outlook on the future course of unemployment rates. A month \\r\\nago, Professor Wallich cautiously suggested we might reach 5-1/2 \\r\\npercent by year-end. He now is suggesting that something in the \\r\\nrange of 5-1/2 to 6 percent seems quite likely.

The Bank's most recent survey of manufacturers in \\r\\nthe district (expressed in the form of diffusion indexes) show \\r\\nrebounds in new orders and shipments during June, and a sharp \\r\\ndecline in inventories, Employment stabilized, after declining since \\r\\nlast autumn.

The \\r\\nfollowing conclusions emerged from our informal survey: (1) sales \\r\\nhave been weakening for district businesses; (2) there is widespread \\r\\nevidence that merchandise is being sold below posted list prices; \\r\\n(3) the commercial paper market is regarded as relatively stable, \\r\\nbut banks have accommodated and expect to further accommodate firms \\r\\nthat have been borrowers in the commercial paper market; (4) large \\r\\nCD rates are up at some banks, with rates at a few small banks \\r\\nexceeding 9 percent; (5) corporate liquidity is still a major \\r\\nconcern; and (6) loan demand remains strong, matching or exceeding \\r\\nseasonal expectations.], [The nonbankers noted that sales appeared to weaken somewhat in their \\r\\nindustries in recent weeks. Despite the trend in sales, most \\r\\nrespondents noted that their inventory situation had remained \\r\\nsatisfactory so that no change in inventory policy had been \\r\\nnecessary. There was an indication (confirmed by aggregate data for \\r\\nthe region) that petroleum inventories were too high at present, \\r\\neven though sales of the petroleum industry have remained strong. \\r\\nRecent reductions have been made in district petroleum production \\r\\nallowables, particularly in Texas, to curtail crude petroleum \\r\\nmining. The petroleum inventory situation may also improve because a \\r\\nshortage of tankers and reduced Libyan production has caused some \\r\\nstrengthening of domestic demand.], [The respondents were nearly unanimous in citing that , [], \\r\\n  price-cutting \\r\\nfrom posted list prices had occurred in their industries. It was \\r\\nfurther indicated that this practice has been on the increase in \\r\\nrecent weeks. Price-cutting has probably been one response to the \\r\\nweakening sales reported in several industries. One district banker \\r\\nsuggested that a form of price-cutting had been on the increase in \\r\\nthe banking industry. This was occurring through the use of gift \\r\\npremiums, reducing the size of the minimum balance required to avoid \\r\\na checking account service charge, and other innovative promotions \\r\\nto attract deposits.\\r\\n], [A series of questions were asked pertaining to recent developments \\r\\nin the commercial paper market. Nonbankers who have been active in \\r\\nthe commercial paper market, either as issuers or as buyers, \\r\\nreported no change in recent weeks in their activity or in their \\r\\npolicies toward the commercial paper market. Several bankers in the \\r\\narea, however, noted that they had recently accommodated borrowers \\r\\nwho were in the commercial paper market. Of particular note was the \\r\\nrecent accommodation by one banker of finance companies that were \\r\\nknown to utilize the commercial paper market. In addition, several \\r\\nbankers mentioned that they had outstanding lines of credit to \\r\\ncompanies that were in the commercial paper market and anticipated \\r\\nsome additional activation of these lines of credit in the near \\r\\nfuture.], [Banking respondents to our latest survey noted a generally strong \\r\\nloan demand. All reported loan demand to be either exceeding or \\r\\nmatching seasonal expectations. The source of this loan demand is \\r\\napparently from general business, but large real estate development \\r\\nprojects were particularly singled out by one banker.], [The recent change in Regulation Q rates for large denomination CD's \\r\\nwith maturities of 30 to 89 days has brought mixed responses from \\r\\ndistrict bankers. About half of our survey respondents reported that \\r\\nthey had increased their offering rates (usually to the 7 1/2 - 8 \\r\\npercent range, but exceeding 9 percent at a few small banks) while \\r\\nhalf reported they had not changed their rates. Of the bankers who \\r\\nhad increased rates on CD's, only one reported any reduced reliance \\r\\non sources of borrowed funds, such as Eurodollars, commercial paper, \\r\\nor federal funds. To the extent that additional funds are being \\r\\nattracted to district banks by the higher CD rates, it appears these \\r\\nfunds are being utilized to make new loan or investment commitments \\r\\nand not to reduce reliance on borrowed sources of funds.

Meanwhile, repair shops for automobiles and \\r\\nother durable goods are reporting record volumes of business; a \\r\\nregional parts distribution center for a major automobile \\r\\nmanufacturer in the twin cities reports that the demand for \\r\\nautomobile parts is so great that its crews are working overtime. \\r\\nAlthough automobile sales in the district are still at depressed \\r\\nlevels, the weakness seems to be centered on the more expensive \\r\\nmodels while the market for lighter, economy models and used autos \\r\\nappears to be relatively strong.], [The greatest evidence of \"price shading\" in the district is at the \\r\\nretail level. In addition to markdowns on automobiles, the directors \\r\\nfelt that retailers were holding sales earlier than usual this \\r\\nsummer and were offering larger discounts. One reason given for this \\r\\nwas that inventories appear to be larger than desired because of the \\r\\ngeneral slowing in retail sales. Retailers are also concerned that \\r\\nthey will \"get stuck\" with merchandise that was ordered before the \\r\\ntruckers' strike and is only now arriving.], [There appears to be very little \"price shading\" for industrial \\r\\ngoods, and directors and officers of the bank cited a number of \\r\\ncases where prices have actually risen in the past few weeks. In \\r\\ngeneral the feeling was that manufacturers do not have adequate \\r\\nmargins with which to cut prices. As one director put it, \"business \\r\\nis hurting but volume at a loss doesn't help.\" Another felt that \\r\\nindustrial suppliers are beginning to drop unprofitable lines. On \\r\\nthe other hand one director indicated that discounts in some \\r\\nconstruction materials are greater now than they were a year ago. He \\r\\nwas careful to point out, however, that list prices have risen \\r\\nduring the past year, and as a result, the net effect on prices is \\r\\nnot clear. He noted that sales efforts among construction materials \\r\\ndistributors have intensified, and that they have improved services \\r\\nincluding schedules in order to increase their sales.], [The slowing in sales along with a decreased availability of funds \\r\\nhas led to an increase in district business failures. The three most \\r\\ncommon characteristics of failing businesses are that they were \\r\\nrelatively young firms, were in industries in which entry is fairly \\r\\neasy, and/or were undercapitalized. Of the 21 failures of which one \\r\\nleading district banker was aware, all could be attributed to one or \\r\\nmore of these factors. One director observed that the number of \\r\\nfailures or near failures in the construction industry has risen in \\r\\nrecent months. The primary cause for this is the lack of working \\r\\ncapital, a problem which is chronic in the industry, but which has \\r\\nbecome increasingly acute because of the large number of recent \\r\\nstrikes and the slowing in construction activity.], [\\r\\n                            We serve the public by pursuing a growing economy and stable financial system that work for all of us., [\\n]]]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

While it was thought the current strains in the \\r\\nfinancial markets did not pose a serious immediate threat to \\r\\nbusiness activity, considerable concern was expressed regarding \\r\\nbusiness liquidity.], [Only two of the Federal Reserve Bank Directors who attended the \\r\\nearly July meetings at New York and Buffalo were aware of any price \\r\\nshading by manufacturers, but more directors mentioned other signs \\r\\nof an improvement in the overall price situation. These included \\r\\nannounced price cuts, particularly at the retail level, as well as \\r\\nprice shading at the retail level by giving the customer greater \\r\\nvalue. With regard to, [],  \\r\\nunder-the-counter price adjustments, it was \\r\\nreported that Bethlehem Steel Corporation had taken a strong \\r\\nposition against such a marketing practice. As for announced cuts by \\r\\nmanufacturers, one director noted receiving an announcement of a \\r\\nthree percent reduction in the price of cans for packaging \\r\\nbeverages. At the retail level, there has been considerable price \\r\\ncutting by automobile dealers as well as by other retail outlets, \\r\\nwith the aim of either reducing inventories or building sales \\r\\nvolume.], [Retail store sales reportedly were holding up well, except at downtown stores and during night shopping hours. Sales apparently were \\r\\nbeing bolstered by aggressive merchandising. The head of a large \\r\\nchain observed, however, that retail stores need an increase of \\r\\nthree to three and one half percent in volume to bring profit up to \\r\\nlast year's level. Contributing to this need were higher costs \\r\\nstemming from increases in wage rates, in shipping charges, and in \\r\\nshoplifting.\\r\\n], [The directors were virtually unanimous in believing that the more \\r\\ncautious capital spending pattern that apparently has developed in \\r\\nrecent months will continue into 1971. New programs were being \"very \\r\\ncarefully reviewed,\" and many projects were being slowed down or \\r\\nindefinitely deferred. However, projects for which commitments are \\r\\ntoo far along to be canceled or postponed are being completed, as \\r\\nprobably will be projects designed to cut production costs and \\r\\nincrease productivity. Although an upstate New York banker remarked \\r\\nthat there were no signs of cutback in his area, he observed that \\r\\nmost of the capital spending there was on construction for \\r\\nmunicipalities and school districts, for which firm contracts had \\r\\nbeen arranged \"long ago.\" On the other hand, a community college \\r\\nconstruction project for which bids were recently obtained may have \\r\\nto be canceled because the bids are so far above the original \\r\\nestimates.], [\\r\\nThe few comments made on the inventory situation suggested that \\r\\ninventories were higher than were desired. A New York banker \\r\\ncommented that inventories in general are eight to ten percent above \\r\\na year ago, and that increased inventories were particularly evident \\r\\nin the soft goods area. The chairman of a large manufacturing firm \\r\\nobserved that inventories were high mainly because business \"is not \\r\\nselling goods as fast as desired,\" although special factors such as \\r\\nthe recent truckers' strike in Chicago had contributed to the \\r\\nbuildup, as had \"a new permanent inflation factor\" that has been \\r\\nbuilt into inventories.], [Most directors seemed to believe the current strains in the \\r\\nfinancial markets did not pose a serious threat to business activity \\r\\nat the present time, although the head of a large New York City bank \\r\\ndeclared he thought there would be \"adverse\" effects, but was unable \\r\\nto judge whether these would be \"serious.\" Despite the near-consensus that there was no immediate threat, a number of directors \\r\\nand other business executives did indicate concern regarding \\r\\nfinancial developments. A banker from upstate New York noted that \\r\\nmany businessmen who have long-term financings in the offing are \\r\\nattempting to arrange standby intermediate or short-term credits as \\r\\npossible alternative solutions to their financing needs. An \\r\\ninvestment banker commented that his firm had been marketing four-to-five year securities for many clients, and that if inflation is \\r\\nnot halted, he sees \"an end to public financing of debt issues.\" A \\r\\nlarge retailer observed that small manufacturers were in serious \\r\\nshape with regard to liquidity; they cannot borrow as easily as very \\r\\nbig concerns, and at the same time big retailers are slower in \\r\\nmaking payments to them than in the past, inasmuch as the discount \\r\\nfor prompt payment is less than the cost of borrowing money. \\r\\nCustomer payments to retail stores were also noted as slower than \\r\\nusual, The head of a New York academic institution declared the long \\r\\ndecline in the stock market had cut gifts to private educational \\r\\ninstitutions and had drastically reduced the market value of \\r\\nholdings of endowed institutions.

The chairman of a large mutual savings bank \\r\\nremarked, late in June, that although official figures indicate a \\r\\nrecent pick-up in deposits at thrift institutions, there is no \\r\\nevidence of such a movement in New York City. He thought that most \\r\\nof the deposit money that was being withdrawn was probably going \\r\\ninto bonds.

Most of them see a slowdown in the pace of economic \\r\\nactivity with no sign of any quick upswing, but few report any \\r\\nfeeling that the slowdown will worsen. Both prices and costs are \\r\\nexpected to show further increases, and price shading is not \\r\\nwidespread. The area with the most severe problems in terms of \\r\\nunemployment continues to be the Pacific Northwest, where both the \\r\\naircraft and lumber industries continue to reduce employment. \\r\\nDirectors who are associated with the lumber industry report that \\r\\ncompanies are curtailing production, with many firms on a four-day \\r\\nweek and usually with only one shift. In Oregon, it is reported, the \\r\\nmajority of the small mills have been shut down for over two months \\r\\nand many may never reopen. Even some large firms dependent upon \\r\\npublic timber are having difficulties, and one director forecast \\r\\nthat some large firms would be out of business by spring.], [Another area with above-average unemployment is Southern California. \\r\\nThe aircraft and defense industries are suffering the most, but \\r\\ntheir relative impact on that area's economy is smaller than in the \\r\\nNorthwest, and total economic activity in Southern California \\r\\nremains strong. A large electronics manufacturer in the San \\r\\nFrancisco area has reduced its workweek in response to a fall in \\r\\norders. It chose this method of reducing output rather than having \\r\\nlayoffs and risking losing skilled employees. Declines in \\r\\nmanufacturing, mainly machinery and electrical goods, are also \\r\\nreported for Arizona, where total employment declined for the first \\r\\ntime since January. Unemployment is higher in Alaska, in part \\r\\nbecause of a slowdown in the oil field development.], [Prices continue to rise, with the notable exception of lumber and \\r\\nplywood prices. Consumer demand remains steady, although where \\r\\nunemployment is high the sustaining effect of unemployment payments \\r\\nmay disappear as benefits are used up. Therefore retail sales may \\r\\nfall more in such areas. Another unfavorable aspect noted by one \\r\\ndirector is the increase in the number of personal bankruptcies.], [Businesses continue to face a squeeze on their profitsâ€”especially \\r\\nthose now experiencing substantial wage demands. Retailers are \\r\\ndescribed in some cases as reluctant to maintain margins by \\r\\nincreasing prices. There is continued emphasis on cutting costs. As \\r\\npart of this trend, bankers report reduced demand for loans to \\r\\nsupport inventories. In some industries, prospective labor problems \\r\\nadd to uncertainty.], [\\r\\nThe oil industry has some difficulties in controlling discounting of \\r\\ngasoline on the retail level, despite withdrawal of temporary dealer \\r\\nallowances. In addition, it has some supply problems caused by the \\r\\nloss of Arabian crude oil supplies due to the shutdown of the Trans-Arabian pipeline and cutbacks in Libyan oil production. There are \\r\\nalso uncertainties about the future need for the production of \\r\\nunleaded gasoline.], [\\r\\nIn agriculture the picture is mixed. Cattle prices continue to hold, \\r\\nbut there is weakness in some areas dependent upon fruits and \\r\\nvegetables, such as Washington and Southern California. The decline \\r\\nin citrus production is not expected to be compensated by higher \\r\\nprices. In Washington, packers are operating at below capacity.

Steel production for the \\r\\nthird quarter, largely reflecting demand from auto companies, is expected to be \\r\\nslightly above the second quarter after allowance for the normal summer \\r\\nslowdown. Several local labor-management disputes in the Cleveland area have \\r\\nbeen settled at high cost. District bankers report they expect loan demand to \\r\\nremain strong and money market conditions to stay comfortable in the immediate \\r\\nfuture. Several of our Branch Directors expect the economy to remain sluggish in \\r\\nthe foreseeable future.], [Economic activity in the District improved significantly in June after the \\r\\ntermination of major strikes, and preliminary and limited data suggest that \\r\\nactivity remained at about the same level in July. The District's insured \\r\\nunemployment rate was essentially unchanged in July, and steel production rose \\r\\nmoderately. Economists in the steel industry report that auto companies have \\r\\nplaced orders at normal levels for steel deliveries for July, August, and \\r\\nSeptember, despite auto strike possibilities. Auto firms regularly place a \\r\\nnormal level of steel orders before contract negotiations, and this year will \\r\\nask steel firms to take finished steel into inventories if a strike materializes \\r\\nin mid-September. Furthermore, if a strike occurs, production should not decline \\r\\nas much as shipments because inventory building will probably occur at the mills \\r\\nlate in the year. Trade sources report that auto companies are unable to get \\r\\ncommitments for Japanese steel to be delivered next year. Apparently, Japan will \\r\\nnot accept steel orders above the voluntary quotas, and will not divert steel to \\r\\nautomotive companies from regular customers. Steel industry economists in our \\r\\narea report export demand is declining rapidly.], [Striking sheetmetal workers and plumbers in Cleveland settled their disputes at \\r\\nthe end of July and in early August. Only one major unionâ€”pipefittersâ€”remains on \\r\\nstrike, but this is enough to keep construction at a reduced level in the \\r\\nCleveland area. The principal unresolved issue is the hiring of minority \\r\\nworkers. A $3 per hour increase over three years (raising journeyman rates by \\r\\n1972 to $9.41 for painters, $10.20 for iron workers, and $10.81 for sheetmetal \\r\\nworkers, for example) appears to be the pattern of settlement accepted by all of \\r\\nthe other construction crafts in the area. The increases will further widen the \\r\\nlocal-national differential in average hourly earnings for journeymen and \\r\\nhelpers in all construction trades (last year, $5.99 in Cleveland and $4.78 in \\r\\nthe nation).], [Economists and senior investment officers at several of the largest banks in the \\r\\nDistrict were recently surveyed informally regarding their current views and \\r\\nexpectations about the economy, the banking situation, and money market \\r\\nconditions. Almost all of the respondents indicated they expect the economy to \\r\\nremain sluggish during the second half of 1970, although most of the economists \\r\\nlook for a modest increase in real activity. All of the major banks in the \\r\\nDistrict are experiencing strong loan demand and demand is expected to remain \\r\\nbrisk over the foreseeable future. Respondents felt that the present comfortable \\r\\ntone of the money market would continue and that funds would be readily \\r\\navailable to banks at interest rates equal to or slightly below current levels. \\r\\nOne investment officer from a large bank reported that they had just reduced the \\r\\nrate on 60-89 day money to 7 3/4 per cent and would now pay a uniform rate \\r\\nacross the board in the , [], \\r\\n30-89 day maturity range. The same bank anticipates \\r\\nanother reduction in the CD rate in the near future. All of the banks are much \\r\\nmore concerned about the credit worthiness of borrowers than formerly, and \\r\\nexpressed the view that this concern would persist.], [Several of our Cincinnati Branch Directors, at a meeting of the Board last \\r\\nMonday, commented about the continued sluggishness of the economy.

They indicated that business sales are slightly ahead of a \\r\\nyear ago, and inventories of most firms are \"about right.\" Some excess capacity \\r\\nis reported. Capital spending apparently peaked in 1969 and is currently \\r\\ndeclining. Capital spending is expected to increase somewhat in 1971 but to \\r\\nremain below the current-dollar level of 1969. Employment cutbacks are reported \\r\\nby more than half of the responding firms, but wages and salaries are up \\r\\nconsiderably. Hurricane Celia hit the West Gulf Coast of Texas and caused damage \\r\\nestimated in excess of $500 million.], [Most of the corporate executives reported that sales were a little higher so far \\r\\nin 1970 than in the same period a year ago. One electronic firm indicated that \\r\\nsales this year had lagged behind the level of a year ago, and another noted \\r\\nsome softness in their recent orders. One firm in the computer industry reported \\r\\nthat sales so far this year were up from a year ago but weakness is expected in \\r\\nthe months ahead. One firm particularly noted an increase in price consciousness \\r\\namong their customers.], [Although sales have not been particularly strong, most of the firms indicate \\r\\nthat they are about in line with expectations. This would suggest that the \\r\\nbusiness slowdown was correctly anticipated by most. Because the correct sales \\r\\ntrend was anticipated by most firms, current inventory levels are considered \\r\\n\"about right\" by the majority. Three firms did indicate that their inventories \\r\\nwere somewhat too high at the present time.], [More than half of the firms represented in our sample project capital spending \\r\\nfor the year 1970 to be less than in 1969. The dollar value of capital spending \\r\\nby these firms will likely be down about 14 per cent in 1970 from the 1969 \\r\\nlevel. Much of the weakness in capital spending apparently stems from a trimming \\r\\nback of earlier plans. Half of the respondents indicated that the dollar value \\r\\nof their capital appropriations for the second half of 1970 was less than \\r\\nearlier preliminary plans. Not a single firm reported that capital \\r\\nappropriations for the second half of this year would be larger than their \\r\\npreliminary plans. These declining capital spending plans are consistent with \\r\\nthe report of \"a little\" excess capacity at four firms while one reported much \\r\\nexcess capacity. There were no reports of capacity shortage. Some of the decline \\r\\nin capital spending from the high 1969 level is accounted for by electronic and \\r\\ncomputer firms that have been affected by the trimming of the defense budget, as \\r\\nwell as by the overall business slowdown. Another major factor in the capital \\r\\nspending decline is the tapering off of construction by a large national gas \\r\\npipeline company. The lack of new gas supplies has reduced their need to expand \\r\\nthe transmission system. The only real strength in 1970 capital spending comes \\r\\nfrom one electric utility and some oil drilling and refining firms.], [Capital spending for 1971 for this group of firms is now planned to be up \\r\\nslightly from the expected 1970 level but still about 7 per cent below the \\r\\nrealized 1969 level in current dollars. Two-thirds of the firms actually expect \\r\\ncapital outlays to be less in 1971 than in 1970. A substantial increase in \\r\\ncapital spending is projected by a large oil company.], [Every firm responding to this questionnaire reports that employee wages and \\r\\nsalaries are up this year. The most common increase was 6 to 7 per cent while \\r\\nthe range was from 3.5 to 8 per cent. More than half of the firms have cut back \\r\\ntheir employment level this year with the cutbacks ranging from as low as 1 per \\r\\ncent to as high as 25 per cent.

Damage estimates range from $500 million to $1 billion. Banking services were \\r\\nhalted for two days and then reopened on a limited basis. About 3 per cent of \\r\\nthe U.

District manufacturers \\r\\nresponding to our latest industrial expectations survey feel that \\r\\nthe rate of advance in District manufacturing sales will continue \\r\\nsluggish during the remainder of 1970.], [In responding to a question on corporate profits, bank directors and \\r\\nofficers indicated that profits in the Ninth District suffered or at \\r\\nbest held steady during the second quarter, although there were \\r\\nnotable exceptions. In response to this situation numerous examples \\r\\nof cost cutting were cited. An economist for a large national \\r\\nmanufacturer stated that attitudes have changed in his company on \\r\\nwhat constitutes a necessary cost. One large brewery in the Twin \\r\\nCities cut its current advertising budget by $800,000. District \\r\\nemployers have curtailed their utilization of labor through layoffs \\r\\nand overtime reductions, and a large Minneapolis computer \\r\\nmanufacturer instructed each employee to take ten days of unpaid \\r\\nvacation before the end of the year. Cost cutting is also \\r\\nmanifesting itself in reductions in capital spending and inventory \\r\\ncutbacks.], [\\r\\nAlthough reports indicate District businessmen are trying to cut \\r\\ninventories, several cases of unwanted inventory accumulation were \\r\\nreported. One large Twin City manufacturer's inventory increased \\r\\nbecause of overly optimistic sales projections. Reports reveal that \\r\\nthe large retailers and a national mail order house have accumulated \\r\\ninventories because of the trucking strike. They are receiving this \\r\\nsummer' s seasonal merchandise late and are being forced to cut its \\r\\nprice to avoid carrying it over.], [One factor, however, that will impede cost cutting efforts by \\r\\nDistrict businessmen is the recent large wage concessions granted to \\r\\nthe construction workers and Teamsters. As a result of these \\r\\nsettlements, bank directors indicate that unions in their areas are \\r\\nbecoming very aggressive in their wage demands, making the \\r\\nsettlement of some current negotiations difficult. One director \\r\\nreports that construction companies are cutting overtime because of \\r\\nthe large wage settlements.], [\\r\\n                            We serve the public by pursuing a growing economy and stable financial system that work for all of us., [\\n]]]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

A mixture of reports is common, however, within most manufacturing industries important to this District, and the slight improvement is due to fewer reports of further declines rather than to any significant resurgence of orders.], [Recent improvement in retail sales, especially in automobiles, is reported. Reports from West Virginia, however, indicate that business has been seriously affected by the current coal miners' strike. Manufacturers' inventories, while apparently being reduced somewhat, are still reported to be higher than desired.], [\\r\\nThe District employment situation apparently remains weak. While some further employment declines are reported in textiles, chemicals, metals, and electrical equipment, the declines do not appear as widespread as they were two or three months ago. The length of the work week, however, is reportedly still decreasing in manufacturing industries.], [\\r\\nReports of increasing unemployment are common throughout the Fifth District, and available labor supplies are generally regarded as adequate. Respondents in manufacturing as well as trade and services report skilled labor to be in relatively short supply, but they feel that there are adequate numbers of unskilled workers available.], [\\r\\nReports indicate that, on balance, prices continue to rise in the District. Coal, fabricated metal items, and electrical machinery are among the District's manufacturing industries in which prices are reported increasing. Large increases in coal prices are of considerable concern in the region because of implications they have for electric utility rates as well as other services. Few instances of actual declines in list prices are reported, although respondents continue to report evidence of price shading. Continued upward pressure on wages is reported in nonferrous metals and furniture manufacturing.], [Residential construction, which has been severely depressed in the District, is reported somewhat improved in recent weeks. Though still on the down side, some improvement is reported in residential building activity in certain areas of North Carolina, Virginia, and West Virginia, and in the Baltimore area. Nonresidential building, which has fared better in recent months, apparently is continuing to improve throughout the District generally.], [Loan demand of all types at banks in the District apparently has failed to keep pace with last month's reported rise. Demand for business loans is reported essentially unchanged, and consumer loan demand has increased only slightly. Increases in mortgage loan demand were reported to be significant in May and June, but began to taper last month, and were only marginal in the most recent four-week period.], [\\r\\nThe number of respondents reporting that they expect further decline in general economic activity diminished substantially in the most recent survey. Evidence of optimism, however, remains spotty, and apparently no general expectation of an immediate recovery exists yet in the Fifth District.], [Respondents in the District have been far from unanimous in their evaluations of their capital spending plans. While some respondents have indicated reductions, planned capital spending apparently has not been substantially reduced in recent months. The latest survey, however, indicates somewhat more widespread reductions than before, especially in textiles, chemicals, and furniture manufacturing.], [Inventories in manufacturing and in trade and services remain on the high side.
